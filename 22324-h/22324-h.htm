<h3>I. BEFORE THE ATTACK.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />


<p>By means of a lorry lift from railhead, and a horse borrowed from the
Divisional Ammunition Column, I found Brigade Headquarters in a
village that the Germans had occupied before their retreat in the
spring of 1917.</p>

<p>The huge, red-faced, grey-haired adjutant, best of ex-ranker officers,
welcomed me on the farmhouse steps with a hard handshake and a
bellowing "Cheerio!" followed by, "Now that you're back, I can go on
leave."</p>

<p>In the mess the colonel gave me kindly greeting, and told me something
of the Brigade's ups and downs since I had left France in August 1917,
wounded at Zillebeke: how all the old and well-tried battery
commanders became casualties before 1917 was out, but how, under
young, keen, and patiently selected leaders, the batteries were
working up towards real efficiency again. Then old "Swiffy," the
veterinary officer, came in, and the new American doctor, who appeared
armed with two copies of the 'Saturday Evening Post.' It was all very
pleasant; and the feeling that men who had got to know you properly in
the filthy turmoil and strain of Flanders were genuinely pleased to
see you again, produced a glow of real happiness. I had, of course, to
go out and inspect the adjutant's new charger&mdash;a big rattling
chestnut, conceded to him by an A.S.C. major. A mystery gift, if ever
there was one: for he was a handsome beast, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>and chargers are getting
very rare in France. "They say he bucks," explained the adjutant.
"He'll go for weeks as quiet as a lamb, and then put it across you
when you don't expect it. I'm going to put him under treatment."</p>

<p>"Where's my groom?" he roared. Following which there was elaborate
preparation of a weighted saddle&mdash;not up to the adjutant's 15 stone 5,
but enough to make the horse realise he was carrying something; then
an improvised lunging-rope was fashioned, and for twenty minutes the
new charger had to do a circus trot and canter, with the adjutant as a
critical and hopeful ringmaster. In the end the adjutant mounted and
rode off, shouting that he would be back in half an hour to report on
the mystery horse's preliminary behaviour.</p>

<p>Then the regimental sergeant-major man&oelig;uvred me towards the horse
lines to look at the newly made-up telephone cart team.</p>

<p>"You remember the doctor's fat mare, sir&mdash;the wheeler, you used to
call her? Well, she is a wheeler now, and a splendid worker too. We
got the hand-wheeler from B Battery, and they make a perfect pair. And
you remember the little horse who strayed into our lines at
Thiepval&mdash;'Punch' we used to call him&mdash;as fat as butter, and didn't
like his head touched? Well, he's in the lead; and another bay, a twin
to him, that the adjutant got from the &nbsp;&mdash;th Division. Changed
'Rabbits' for him. You remember 'Rabbits,' sir?&mdash;nice-looking horse,
but inclined to stumble. All bays now, and not a better-looking
telephone team in France."</p>

<p>And then an anxious moment. Nearest the wall in the shed which
sheltered the officers' horses stood my own horse&mdash;dear old
Silvertail, always a gentleman <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>among horses, but marked in his likes
and dislikes. Would he know me after my six months' absence? The grey
ears went back as I approached, but my voice seemed to awake
recognition. Before long a silver-grey nose was nozzling in the old
confiding way from the fourth button towards the jacket pocket where
the biscuits used to be kept. All was well with the world.</p>

<p>A rataplan on a side-drum feebly played in the street outside!&mdash;the
village crier announcing that a calf had committed hari-kari on one of
the flag-poles put up to warn horsemen that they mustn't take short
cuts over sown land. The aged crier, in the brown velveteen and the
stained white corduroys, took a fresh breath and went on to warn the
half-dozen villagers who had come to their doorways that uprooting the
red flags would be in defiance of the express orders of Monsieur le
Maire (who owned many fields in the neighbourhood). The veal resulting
from the accident would be shared out among the villagers that
evening.</p>

<p>My camp-bed was put up in a room occupied by the adjutant; and during
and after dinner there was much talk about the programme of intensive
training with which the Brigade was going to occupy itself while out
at rest. For the morrow the colonel had arranged a scheme&mdash;defence and
counter-attack&mdash;which meant that skeleton batteries would have to be
brought up to upset and demolish the remorseless plans of an imaginary
German host; and there was diligent studying of F.A.T. and the latest
pamphlets on Battery Staff Training, and other points of knowledge
rusted by too much trench warfare.</p>

<p>It was exactly 2 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> on the morrow. We were mounted and
moving off to participate in this <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>theoretical battle, when the
"chug-chug-chug" of a motor-cycle caused us to look towards the hill
at the end of the village street: a despatch-rider, wearing the
blue-and-white band of the Signal Service. The envelope he drew from
his leather wallet was marked "urgent."</p>

<p>"It's real war, gentlemen," said the colonel quietly, having read the
contents; "we move at once. Corps say that the enemy are massing for
an attack."</p>

<p>Then he gave quick, very definite orders in the alert confident manner
so well known to all his officers and men.</p>

<p>"Send a cycle orderly to stop Fentiman bringing up his teams! You can
be ready to march by 3 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> ... Stone. Townsend, you'd better
send off your groom to warn your battery! Times and order of march
will be sent out by the adjutant within a quarter of an hour! One
hundred yards' distance between every six vehicles on the march! No
motor-lorries for us this time, so all extra kit and things you can't
carry will have to be dumped, and a guard left behind!"</p>

<p>A clatter of horsemen spreading the news followed.</p>

<p>I stood at the door of the village's one caf&eacute; and watched two of our
batteries pass. The good woman who kept it asked if I thought the
Germans would come there again. "They took my husband with them a
prisoner when they went a year ago," she said slowly. My trust in our
strength as I had seen it six months before helped me to reassure her;
but to change the subject, I turned to the penny-in-the-slot music
machine inside, the biggest, most gaudily painted musical box I've
ever seen. "Did the Boches ever try this?" I asked. "No, only once,"
she replied, brightening. "They had a mess in the next room, and never
came in here."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll have a pen'orth for luck," said I, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>avoiding "Norma"
and "Poet and Peasant," moved the pointer towards a chansonette,
something about a good time coming. Such a monstrous wheezing and
gurgling, such a deafening clang of cracked cymbals, such a Puck-like
concatenation of flat notes and sudden thuds that told of broken
strings! And so much of it for a ten-centime piece. When the tumult
began a third time I made off. No wonder the Germans only tried the
instrument once!</p>

<p>By 8 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> we found ourselves in a sort of junction village,
its two main roads alive with long lines of moving batteries and
lorries and transport waggons. Inky blackness everywhere, for the Hun
bombed the place nightly, and "No lights" was a standing order. Odd
shouts and curses from drivers in difficulties with their steeds; the
continuous cry of "Keep to the right!" from the military police; from
a garden close by, the howl of an abandoned dog; and from some
dilapidated house Cockney voices harmonising: "It's a Long, Long
Trail." There would be no moon that night, and a moaning wind was
rising.</p>

<p>A halt had been called in front of our column, and there was talk of
the batteries watering their horses before completing the further
three miles to their roadside encampments. The Headquarters party had
resigned themselves to a good hour's wait, when I heard the adjutant's
voice calling my name.</p>

<p>"Headquarters will go up to Rouez to-night, and we shall mess with the
General," he shouted at me from out of the darkness. "Traffic isn't
supposed to go this way to the right; but you come with me, and we'll
talk to the A.P., at the Corps Commandant's office. They ought to let
our little lot through."</p>

<p>Headquarters mess cart and G.S. waggon, Maltese <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>cart and telephone
waggon did indeed get through, and by 9.15 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> the horses
were watered and fed, the men housed, and we ourselves were at dinner
in the cottage that had become Divisional R.A. Headquarters.</p>

<p>A cheerful dinner with plenty of talk. It wasn't believed now that the
Hun would attack next morning; but, in any case, we were going up to
relieve a R.H.A. unit. The brigade-major was very comforting about the
conveniences of our new positions. Then some one carried the
conversation away and beyond, and, quoting an "Ole Luk-Oie" story,
submitted that the higher realms of generalship should include the
closer study of the personal history and characteristics&mdash;mental and
moral&mdash;of enemy commanders. Some one else noted that the supposed
speciality of the General immediately opposite us was that of making
fierce attacks across impassable marshes. "Good," put in a third some
one. "Let's puzzle the German staff by persuading him that we have an
Etonian General in this part of the line, a very celebrated
'wet-bob.'" Which sprightly suggestion made the Brigadier-General
smile. But it was my good fortune to go one better. I had to partner
him at bridge, and brought off a grand slam.</p>

<p>Next morning snow; and the colonel, the adjutant, and myself had a
seven-miles' ride before us. The Germans had not attacked, but the
general move-up of fresh divisions was continuing, and our brigade had
to take over the part of the line we were told off to defend by 5
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span></p>

<p>All the talk on the way up was of the beautiful quietude of the area
we were riding through: no weed-choked houses with the windows all
blown in; no sound <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>of guns, no line of filled-up ambulances; few
lorries on the main thoroughfares; only the khaki-clad road-repairers
and the "Gas Alert" notice-boards to remind us we were in a British
area. As we reached the quarry that was to become Brigade
Headquarters, we marvelled still more. A veritable quarry <i>de luxe</i>. A
mess fashioned out of stone-blocks hewn from the quarry, perfectly cut
and perfectly laid. Six-inch girders to support the concrete roof, and
an underground passage as a funk-hole from bombs, shells, and gas.
Separate strong-room bedrooms for the officers; and some one had had
time to paint on the doors, "O.C., R.F.A. Brigade," "Adjutant,"
"Intelligence Officer, R.F.A.," and "Signal Officer, R.F.A.," with
proper professional skill. Electric light laid on to all these
quarters, and to the Brigade office and the signallers' underground
chamber. Aladdin didn't enjoy a more gorgeous eye-opener on his first
tour of his palace.</p>

<p>"Never seen such headquarters," grinned the adjutant. "Wonder why
there's no place for the Divisional Band."</p>

<p>I shall never forget the content of the next week. The way from
Brigade H.Q., past the batteries and up to the front line, was over a
wide rolling country of ploughed and fallow lands, of the first wild
flowers, of budding hedgerows, of woods in which birds lilted their
spring songs. The atmosphere was fresh and redolent of clean earth;
odd shell-holes you came across were, miracle of miracles,
grass-grown&mdash;a sight for eyes tired with the drab stinking desolation
of Flanders. A more than spring warmth quickened growing things. White
tendrils of fluff floated strangely in the air, and spread thousands
of soft clinging threads over telephone-wires, tree-tops, and across
miles of growing fields&mdash;the curious output of myriads of
spinning-spiders. There were <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>quaintly restful visits to the front
line. The Boche was a mile away at least; and when you were weary of
staring through binoculars, trying to spot enemy movement, you could
sit and lounge, and hum the rag-time "Wait and See the Ducks go by,"
with a new and very thorough meaning. The signal officer was away
doing a course, and I took on his duties: plenty of long walks and a
good deal of labelling to do, but the task was not onerous. "We've
only had one wire down through shell-fire since we've been here," the
signalling officer of the outgoing brigade had told me: and indeed,
until March 21, the telephone-wires to batteries and "O.P.'s" remained
as undisturbed as if they had skirted Devonshire fields and lanes. The
colonel was quite happy, spending two or three hours a day at O.P.'s,
watching our guns register, or do a bit of sniping on the very very
rare occasions when a Hun was spotted.</p>

<p>"I can see how the subalterns shoot on a big open front like this&mdash;and
teach them something," he said. "This is an admirable part of the line
for instruction purposes."</p>

<p>Whether the Boche would attack in force on our part of the front was
argued upon and considered from every point of view. There were
certain natural features that made such an attempt exceedingly
improbable. Nevertheless infantry and artillery kept hard at it,
strengthening our means of defence. One day I did a tour with the
machine-gun commander in order to know the exact whereabouts of the
machine-gun posts. They were superlatively well hidden, and the
major-general himself had to laugh when one battalion commander,
saying, "There's one just about here, sir," was startled by a
corporal's voice near his very boot-toes calling out, "Yes, sir, it's
here, sir." Gunners had the rare experience of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>circling their battery
positions with barbed wire, and siting machine-guns for hand-to-hand
protection of the 18 pdrs. and 4&middot;5 hows.; and special instruction in
musketry and Lewis-gun manipulation was given by infantry instructors.
There was memorable jubilation one morning at our Brigade
Headquarters, when one of the orderlies, a Manchester man who fired
with his left hand, and held the rifle-butt to his left shoulder, beat
the infantry crack shot who came to instruct the H.Q. staff.</p>

<p>Camouflaging is now, of course, a studied science, and our colonel,
who issued special guiding notes to his batteries, had a few sharp
words to say one afternoon. The British soldier, old and new, is
always happy when he is demolishing something; and a sergeant sent to
prepare a pit for a forward gun had collected wood and corrugated iron
for it by pulling to pieces a near-by dummy gun, placed specially to
draw enemy fire. "Bad as some Pioneers I noticed yesterday," said the
colonel tersely. "They shifted a couple of trees to a place where
there had been no trees before and thought that that was camouflage."</p>

<p>Happy confident days! The doctor, noting the almost summery heat that
had set in, talked of the mosquito headquarters that would develop in
the pond near our quarry. "I'll oil that pond," he gave forth, and
prepared accordingly. Each mail brought him additional copies of the
'Saturday Evening Post,' which he devoured every moment he was off
duty.</p>

<p>I made the joyful discovery that the thick stone blocks kept the mess
so dry and at such an even temperature that the hundred decent-quality
cigars I had brought from England could be kept in condition as
perfect as if they were at the Stores. The adjutant learnt that his
new steed could indeed buck; but as the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>afternoon which saw him take
a toss preceded the day on which he left for leave to England, he
forgot to be furious, and went off promising to bring back all sorts
of things for the mess.</p>

<p>Our companion infantry battalion were as gorgeously housed as
ourselves in an adjoining quarry, and at the dinner parties arranged
between their mess and ours reminiscences of Thiepval and Schwaben
Redoubt, and July 1st, 1916, and St Pierre Divion and the Hindenburg
Line, brought out many a new and many an old story.</p>

<p>On the night of March 19th our chief guest was the youthful
lieutenant-colonel who a very few weeks before had succeeded to the
command of the &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;. Tall, properly handsome, with his crisp curling
hair and his chin that was firm but not markedly so; eyes that were
reflective rather than compelling; earnest to the point of an absorbed
seriousness&mdash;we did right to note him well. He was destined to win
great glory in the vortex of flame and smoke and agony and panic into
which we were to be swept within the next thirty-six hours. My chief
recollection of him that night was of his careful attentiveness to
everything said by our own colonel on the science of present-day
war&mdash;the understanding deference paid by a splendid young leader to
the knowledge and grasp and fine character of a very complete gunner.</p>

<h3>II. "THE BOCHE IS THROUGH!"<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>At 5.10 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> on March 20 I was in the mess, casting an
appraising eye upon the coloured study of a girl in pink&mdash;dark-haired,
hazel-eyed, <i>tr&egrave;s soign&eacute;e</i>, but not too sophisticated, one would say;
her beauty of the kind that glows and tells of abundant vitality and a
fresh happy mind. The little American doctor had sacrificed the cover
of one of his beloved 'Saturday Evening Posts' for this portrait, and
with extreme neatness had scissored it out and fastened it on the
wall&mdash;a pleasant change from the cocaine and chocolate-box
suggestiveness of the languorous Kirchner type that in 1916 and 1917
lent a pinchbeck Montmartre atmosphere to so many English messes in
France and Flanders.</p>

<p>The day had been hot and peaceful, the only sound of gun-fire a
six-inch how. registering, and, during a morning tour with the second
lieutenant who had come from one of the batteries to act as temporary
signalling officer, I remembered noting again a weather-beaten
civilian boot and a decayed bowler hat that for weeks had lain
neglected and undisturbed in one of the rough tracks leading to the
front line&mdash;typical of the unchanging restfulness of this part of the
front.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door opened, to admit Colonel &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;, C.O. of the Infantry
Battalion who were our near neighbours in the quarry.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>"Have you had the '<span class="sc">Prepare for Attack</span>'?" he asked abruptly as
we held ourselves to attention.</p>

<p>"No, sir," I replied, and moved to the telephone to ring up Divisional
Artillery Headquarters.</p>

<p>"Just come in," he said; and even as I asked exchange to put me
through to "D.A.," the brigade clerk came in with the telephoned
warning that we had talked about, expected, or refused to believe in
ever since the alarm order to move into the line a fortnight before.</p>

<p>The formal intimation was sent by wire to the batteries, and I
telephoned to find which battery the colonel was visiting and gave him
the news, which, according to our precise and well-thought-out scheme
of defence, was a preliminary warning not intended to interfere with
any work in hand.</p>

<p>Then the doctor and myself and the Divisional Artillery gas officer,
who had called in while on an inspecting tour, settled down to tea,
jam, and water-cress.</p>

<p>That night our dinner guest was the former captain of our 4&middot;5 how.
battery, now in command of a heavy battery that had come into action
within a quarter of a mile of our H.Q. The "<span class="sc">Man Battle
Positions</span>," the order succeeding "<span class="sc">Prepare for Attack</span>" in
the defence programme, was not expected that night, and we gossiped
and talked war and new gunnery devices much as usual. No story goes so
well at mess as the account of some fatuous muddle brought about by
the administrative bewilderments that are apparently inevitable in the
monster armies of to-day. This was one told with quiet relish by our
guest that night:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You remember the &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; show?" he said. "A lot of stores were, of
course, lost in the scramble; and, soon after I joined my present
battery, I had to sit on an inquiry into the mysterious loss of six
waggons <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>belonging to a 60-pounder battery. Two courts of inquiry had
already sat on the matter, and failed to trace the whereabouts of the
waggons, which had been reported in all sorts of places. At the third
inquiry a witness stated that the last place the waggons were seen at
before getting lost was such and such a place. A member of the court
asked casually whether any one had since visited the spot; and as it
was near lunch-time some one else suggested that the court adjourn
while an officer motor-cycled over and made inquiries. And I'm
hanged," concluded the teller of the story, "if the officer didn't
come back and report that the waggons were still there, had been there
all the time, and were in good condition and under a guard. Piles of
official correspondence had been written over the matter, and the
investigation had drifted through all sorts of channels."</p>

<p>Midnight: I had sent out the night-firing orders to our four
batteries, checked watches over the telephone, and put in a twenty
minutes' wrestle with the brain-racking Army Form B. 213. The doctor
and signalling officer had slipped away to bed, and the colonel was
writing his nightly letter home. I smoked a final cigarette and turned
in at 12.30 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span></p>

<p>3.30 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: The telephone bell above my head was tinkling. It
was the brigade-major's voice that spoke. "Will you put your batteries
on some extra bursts of fire between 3.45 and 4.10&mdash;at places where
the enemy, if they are going to attack, are likely to be forming up?
Right!&mdash;that gives you a quarter of an hour to arrange with the
batteries. Good-night!"</p>

<p>My marked map with registered targets for the various batteries was by
the bedside, and I was able, without getting up, to carry out the
brigade-major's instructions. One battery was slow in answering, and
as time began <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>to press I complained with some force, when the
captain&mdash;his battery commander was away on a course&mdash;at last got on
the telephone. Poor Dawson. He was very apologetic. I never spoke to
him again. He was a dead man within nine hours.</p>

<p>I suppose I had been asleep again about twenty minutes when a rolling
boom, the scream of approaching shells, and regular cracking bursts to
right and left woke me up. Now and again one heard the swish and the
"plop" of gas-shells. A hostile bombardment, without a doubt. I looked
at my watch&mdash;4.33 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span></p>

<p>It was hours afterwards before I realised that this was the opening
bombardment of perhaps the mightiest, most overpowering assault in
military history. Had not the "<span class="sc">Prepare for Attack</span>" warning
come in I should have been in pyjamas, and might possibly have lain in
bed for two or three minutes, listening quietly and comfortably while
estimating the extent and intensity of the barrage. But this occasion
was different, and I was up and about a couple of minutes after
waking. Opening my door, I encountered the not unpleasant smell of
lachrymatory gas. The Infantry Battalion headquarters' staff were
already moving out of the quarry to their forward station. By 4.40
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> our colonel had talked over the telephone with two of
the battery commanders. Their reports were quite optimistic. "A
Battery were wise in shifting from their old position three days ago,"
he remarked cheerfully. "The old position is getting a lot of
shelling; there's nothing falling where they are now. Lots of
gas-shelling apparently. It's lucky the batteries had that daily drill
serving the guns with gas-masks on."</p>

<p>The doctor and the acting signal officer came into the mess from their
quarters farther along the quarry. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>"If this gas-shelling goes on, I
guess we shall all have to have lessons in the deaf-and-dumb talk,"
puffed the doctor, pulling off his gas helmet. "Keep that door
closed!"</p>

<p>"D Battery's line gone, sir," rang up the sergeant-signaller.
"M'Quillan and Black have gone out on it."</p>

<p>"Keep Corporal Mann and Sapper Winter on the telephone board to-day,"
I advised Bliss, the youngster who had come to headquarters the day
before to do signal officer. "The colonel will be doing a lot of
telephoning, and they know his methods. Be sure to keep all the
Scotsmen off the board. The colonel says Scotsmen ought never to be
allowed to be telephonists. Impossible to understand what they say."</p>

<p>By 5 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> one of the two officers who overnight had manned
the forward O.P.'s had spoken to us. He was 2000 yards in front of the
most forward battery, but a still small voice sounded confident and
cheery, "A few shells have dropped to the right of the O.P., but
there's no sign of any infantry attack," was his message. We heard
nothing more of him until six weeks afterwards, when his uncle wrote
and told the colonel he was safe, but a prisoner in Germany.</p>

<p>5.15 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: The cook was handing round early morning tea. D
Battery were through again, and we learned that a sergeant had been
killed and one gunner wounded by a 4&middot;2 that had pitched on the edge of
the gun-pit. Two other batteries were cut off from headquarters;
however, we gathered from the battery connected by the buried
cable&mdash;that a week before had kept 500 men busy digging for three
days&mdash;that, as far as they could see, all our batteries were shooting
merrily and according to programme.</p>

<p>By 6 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> the Brigadier-General, C.R.A., had told the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>colonel that the situation to left and right was the same as on our
immediate front: enemy bombardment very heavy and continuing, but no
infantry attack. "We'll shave and have breakfast," the colonel said.
"Looks as if the actual attack must be farther north."</p>

<p>By 8 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> the shelling near us had died down. It was going to
be a lovely spring day, but there was a curiously heavy, clinging
mist. "Want to be careful of the gas shell-holes when the sun warms
up," said the doctor.</p>

<p>Fresh ammunition was coming up from the waggon lines, and our guns
continued to fire on arranged targets. The only additional casualty
was that of an officer of A Battery, who had had a piece of his ear
chipped off by a splinter, and had gone to a dressing station. The
news from B Battery aroused much more interest. An 8-inch shell had
landed right on top of their dug-out mess. No one was inside at the
time, but three officers, who were wont to sleep there, had had every
article of kit destroyed. One subaltern who, in spite of the
<span class="sc">Prepare for Attack</span> notification, had put on pyjamas, was left
with exactly what he stood up in&mdash;viz., pyjamas, British warm, and
gum-boots.</p>

<p>11 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: The colonel had spoken more than once about the
latest situation to the brigade-major of the Infantry Brigade we were
covering, and to our own brigade-major. The staff captain had rung me
up about the return of dirty underclothing of men visiting the
Divisional Baths; there was a base paymaster's query regarding the
Imprest Account which I had answered; a batch of Corps and Divisional
routine orders had come in, notifying the next visits of the field
cashier, emphasising the need for saving dripping, and demanding
information as to the alleged damage done to the bark of certain trees
by our more frolicsome horses. Another <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>official envelope I opened
showed that Records were worrying whether a particular regimental
sergeant-major was an acting or a temporary sergeant-major.</p>

<p>The doctor and the signalling officer had gone forward to visit the
batteries. Hostile shelling seemed to have died out. The mist was
denser than ever&mdash;a weather phenomenon that continued to puzzle.</p>

<p>The telephone bell tinkled again; the colonel turned from the big
map-board on the wall and took up the receiver. "Col. &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;
speaking!&mdash;Yes!&mdash;Have they?&mdash;Sorry to hear that!&mdash;Umph!&mdash;No! no signs
of an attack on our front. Let me know any further
developments&mdash;Good-bye!"</p>

<p>He looked towards me and said briefly, "The Boche infantry have got
over on our left! Came through the mist! I'm afraid the &nbsp;&mdash;rd (our
companion Field Artillery Brigade) have caught it badly. Two of their
batteries have lost all their guns. Get me the brigade-major of the
&nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; Brigade"&mdash;turning to the telephone again.</p>

<p>He told the brigade-major of the Infantry we were covering the news of
the break on the left. No, our infantry had not yet been attacked; but
up in the front it was difficult to see anything in the mist.</p>

<p>The colonel studied his wall-map with intentness, and put a forefinger
on the &nbsp;&mdash;rd Brigade gun positions. "If he's through there we can
expect him in &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; (naming a village of great strategical importance)
in a couple of hours."</p>

<p>A runner came in from C Battery, with whom we had had no communication
for nearly two hours. The Huns seemed to know their position, and had
put over a regular fusilade of 4&middot;2's and 5&middot;9's and gas-shells. The
duck-board running outside the dug-outs behind the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>guns had had six
direct hits, and two of the dug-outs were blown in, also No. 2 gun had
had its off-wheel smashed by a splinter; two men rather badly wounded.</p>

<p>For an hour there was no further news, and, assisted by my two clerks,
I proceeded peacefully with the ordinary routine work of the
adjutant's department. The doctor came back and said that A Battery
were all right, but could not get communication with their F.O.O., not
even by lamp. The 8-inch shell had made very short work of B Battery's
mess. "Poor old Drake," went on the doctor, "he'd got a new pair of
cavalry twill breeches, cost him &pound;5, 10s., and he'd never even worn
them. They came by parcel yesterday, and the fools at the waggon line
sent them up last night." Bliss, he added, had stayed with B Battery,
and was trying to get the line through between A and B, so that
Headquarters could speak to A.</p>

<p>I strolled over to the other side of the quarry where the colonel's,
the doctor's, and my horses were under cover, and found they had not
been troubled by the gas. The men were at dinner; we were to lunch at
1.15 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span></p>

<p>12.40 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: The colonel was again speaking to the Infantry
brigade-major. Still no signs of the German infantry in our front
line.</p>

<p>Then in one swift moment the whole situation changed. A sweating,
staggering gunner blundered into the doorway. He made no pretence at
saluting, but called out with all his strength: "The Boche is
through."</p>

<p>"Who is that man?" demanded the colonel, whipping round like
lightning, and frowning. "Bring him here! Who do you belong to?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>The man had calmed; but before he could reply there was another
interruption. A strained voice outside shouted, "Is the colonel there?
Is the adjutant there?" Hurrying through the doorway, I saw a tall,
perspiring, hatless young subaltern, cursing because he had got
entangled in the guy-ropes of some camouflage netting posts. It was
Hetherton of C Battery.</p>

<p>The colonel came outside. "The Huns came on us in the mist, sir,"
panted Hetherton, "out of the wood. They've killed Dawson, sir." His
voice broke&mdash;"and some of the others. There were only four of us got
away. I came on to tell you." He stopped and breathed hard.</p>

<p>The colonel looked stern, but his voice was smooth and collected.
"That's all right," he said, almost soothingly. "You cut off with your
party and report to the retiring position."</p>

<p>The young man looked dazed, but saluted, and was moving off when the
colonel caught him by the arm. "Come and have a drink, Hetherton,
before going on," he said; "it'll do you good."</p>

<p>"No, thank you, sir," replied Hetherton, and this time he saluted with
body as erect and arm as taut as if on parade. In another second he
had vanished.</p>

<p>There was tense silence as the colonel seized the telephone.</p>

<p>"Put me through to B Battery," he said. Turning towards me, he added:
"Turn out all the men not on telephone duty to take post on the top of
the quarry."</p>

<p>I slipped out and passed the order to the sergeant in charge of the
signallers, roused up the servants, and saw that each man had his
rifle.</p>

<p>"Now, Duncombe," I said to the left-handed orderly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>who had beaten the
infantry crack shot a few days before, "you may have a chance to see
if your eye is in to-day."</p>

<p>When I got back to the mess, I learned that the infantry had news that
the Boche was coming over the crest towards our battle positions. The
major commanding B Battery had told the colonel that his battery and A
had the enemy in full view, and were firing with open sights. "We are
killing hundreds of 'em, sir," he had reported with delightful
insouciance.</p>

<p>One sharp outburst from the colonel. As he came outside to see if our
twenty-odd men were placed in the best positions for defending the
quarry, he looked across and noted that the officers' chargers were
saddled up, and that the grooms were leading them on to the road
above.</p>

<p>"Stop those horses!" he called out angrily. "Who gave orders for them
to leave? Have my horses unsaddled at once. There's always some damn
fellow who does a stupid thing like that and puts the wind up people."</p>

<p>The situation was really saved by the adjutant's new charger, which,
startled by an overcoat the groom had flung over him, began the best
exhibition of bucking he had given since he joined us. As he was in
the lead, and access to the road was by a narrow closed-in track, no
one could get by him.</p>

<p>The grooms in a shamefaced way protested that some one had passed the
"Saddle-up" order, and had a few hectic stinging words addressed to
them. Apparently a mounted orderly, galloping past with a message, had
shouted out something about the enemy being close behind.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>The incident being closed, the colonel and myself strapped on belts
and revolvers. The colonel glanced swiftly at the map position of the
battery that the approaching Huns had scuppered, and then said
quickly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Whatever happens, we shall have time for something to eat. Tell
Manning to bring in lunch."</p>

<h3>III. THE END OF A BATTERY.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>We none of us exactly enjoyed that lunch. It was a nice lunch, too:
the steak cut thin, like steak <i>&agrave; la minute</i>, and not overdone, with
crisp onion sprigs&mdash;"bristled onions" the cook always called them;
and, wonder of wonders! a pudding made by cribbing our bread
allowance, with plum jam and a few strips of macaroni to spice it up.
But the thought that the Boche had scuppered C Battery not a thousand
yards away, and was coming on, did <i>not</i> improve the appetite. And
news of what was really happening was so scant and so indefinite! The
colonel commented once on the tenderness of the steak, and then looked
thoughtful; the doctor remained dumb; for myself, I felt keyed up to
the state that seems to clear the mind and to make one doubly alert in
execution, but my hand did perhaps shake a trifle, and I drank two
whiskies instead of my usual one. I thought of one or two things I
ought to have done and had left undone. I remember feeling distinctly
annoyed because a particular hair lotion on its way from England might
not be delivered. I made sure that a certain discoloured Edward and
Alexandra Coronation medal&mdash;given me for luck&mdash;was secure in my
pocket-book, and stuffed my breast-pockets with all the cigars they
would hold.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>Lunch was finished in about eight minutes, and the imperturbable
Manning cleared away.</p>

<p>"What about these Defence File papers and the maps on the wall, sir?"
I asked the colonel, my mind harking back to newspaper accounts of
German strategic documents captured by us in some of our advances.</p>

<p>"Tear them up and put them on the fire. We won't destroy this
map"&mdash;pointing to a neat and graphic piece of coloured draughtsmanship
showing infantry and artillery dispositions&mdash;"until we have to."</p>

<p>I got to work, and the fire crackled joyously. "Don't say we shall
have to leave these to the Hun, doctor!" I said in shocked tones,
picking up four copies of his adored 'Saturday Evening Post.'</p>

<p>The doctor smiled vaguely, but answered nothing.</p>

<p>Hostile shelling had ceased in our neighbourhood. The sound our ears
waited for was the "putt&mdash;puttr&mdash;putt" of machine-guns, always the
indication of a near infantry attack. I went out and made sure that
the look-outs at both ends of the quarry were doing their work, and
found our little Headquarters army, twenty-five men all told, quiet
and steady, and ready for the moment, should it come.</p>

<p>Half an hour slipped by. We spoke on the telephone to D Battery, who
were on high ground. No, they could see no wave of German infantry
approaching; but Bullivant, B Battery's major, who for the time being
was commanding C Battery's rear uncaptured guns as well as his own
rear and forward 18-pounders, said Huns were coming up <i>en masse</i> from
the south-west. "My guns are firing at them, and A's forward guns are
shootin' as well," he went on. "No! I have seen nothing of our
infantry, but observation is still bad; pockets of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>mist still about.
About Bliss" (the signalling officer who had gone out in the morning
and not returned). "Oh! he stayed some time at our forward position
and then said he was going to get over to A Battery to see why they
were cut off from communication. A lot of 4&middot;2's were coming over at
the time, and there were snipers about. He had to duck three or four
times on the way and then disappeared from view."</p>

<p>Dumble, captain of A Battery, who had come up from the waggon line,
dropped in and hurried off, saying he was going forward to see if he
could get anywhere near the Battery.</p>

<p>3 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: No further developments. "I'm going over to see
General &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;," announced the colonel, naming the brigadier-general
commanding the Infantry Brigade we were covering.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the adjutant of an infantry battalion on our left
rang through and told me that large numbers of Germans were over the
crest and advancing towards what the map showed me was our A Battery's
forward positions. I put A Battery's rear position guns to fire on
them by the map, and guessed that the Battery's forward guns would be
hard at it already.</p>

<p>The colonel came back from the Infantry Brigade, quiet and
self-possessed as ever. "Defence in depth means forces more scattered,
and greater difficulty in keeping up communication," he remarked,
taking a chair and lighting a cigarette. "As far as can be gathered,
the situation is this: The Boche got through in force on our left and
the &nbsp;&mdash;th Division gave way. That bared our own Division's left flank,
and is the reason why the &nbsp;&mdash;rd Brigade had such a bad time and lost so
many <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>guns. The enemy is still coming on; and he's doing too well,
also against the &nbsp;&mdash;th Division on our right. Our own people say he has
worked past their outposts, but that so far as is known they are
holding out. The main battle positions are still safe, and a
counter-attack is being arranged. No news at all of what is happening
farther north!" This was the longest speech the colonel made on that
21st of March.</p>

<p>4 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: I telephoned to the regimental sergeant-major and
told him to come up with the mess cart and the G.S. waggon for
remaining kit, and ordered the servants to pack up. Twenty minutes
later Dumble returned, dusty and dispirited.</p>

<p>"Well, Dumble, what news?" inquired the colonel quickly.</p>

<p>"I couldn't get to the Battery, sir&mdash;the enemy are round it, between
it and our infantry," began Dumble in cut-up tones.</p>

<p>"The nearest I got was in a trench held by the 7th Westshires. An
officer told me that an advanced party of the enemy came over the
crest about 12.30. They fired Very lights in response to a Hun contact
plane that flew towards the switch-trench leading N.E. towards the
battery. By 2 o'clock more enemy infantry were coming from the south,
apparently to join up with the advanced party who had sat tight. Both
A and B Batteries fired on this new body, and they seemed to me
dispersed. But by half-past three, while I was there, Germans in small
parties were crawling through the wire in front of A Battery, and
getting into our trenches."</p>

<p>He paused and wiped his streaming face with his handkerchief.</p>

<p>"What were our infantry doing?" the colonel interrogated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>"There were only small parties of them, sir, and very scattered," went
on Dumble. "The officer and myself, with a dozen men, got along a
trench to within thirty yards of some Huns and fired on them. But
another party, from almost behind us, came along and bombed us back.
We had two killed and brought one wounded man back with us. Another
lot came up on our left and we had to move farther back."</p>

<p>"Was the battery still firing when you came away?" demanded the
colonel.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, firing well, but mostly on fresh parties of Boche eight
hundred yards away."</p>

<p>A knock at the door, and the entrance of a quick-eyed dapper
bombardier from the very battery talked of prevented Dumble
continuing.</p>

<p>"From Major Harville, sir," he said, saluting.</p>

<p>Just a slip from an Army Book 136, in Harville's neat cramped
handwriting. And the message itself was formal enough: a plain bald
statement of a situation that contained heroism, drama, a fight
against odds&mdash;despair, probably, were the truth known; but despair
crowned with the halo of glory and self-sacrifice. The message ran&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"I have fired 2200 rounds, and have only 200 rounds left. My
S.A.A. for Lewis guns and rifles is also running short. Can more
ammunition be sent up immediately, please?</p>

<p>"The enemy has got through the wire in front of the battery, and
is now on two sides of us. If the infantry can assist we can
hold out until dark, when I will retire to rear position."</p></div>

<p>The note was timed 3.40 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> It was now 4.30 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>
The colonel was never more collected or more rapid <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>in acting than at
this moment. In two minutes he had spoken to the Infantry brigadier,
and asked whether immediate assistance could not be sent. Then he
wrote this note to Major Harville&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"Your message timed 3.40 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> received at 4.30
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span></p>

<p>"Hold on: you are doing splendidly, and counter-attacks are
being organised.</p>

<p>"Teams with limbers to withdraw your guns to rear position by 8
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> are being sent for."</p></div>

<p>"I hope the counter-attack is in time," he said to me with a certain
sad thoughtfulness before handing the note to the bombardier. "Do you
think you can get back to the battery, bombardier?" he added. "I'm
afraid you'll find more Boche there now."</p>

<p>"I'll try, sir," replied the bombardier stoutly.</p>

<p>"Off you go then, but be careful!"</p>

<p>In the period of waiting that followed we seemed to have forgotten
that three hours ago we were expecting every minute to have to turn
out and face the Boche with rifle and revolver. Save for the colonel
and two or three of the signallers and a couple of servants, none of
us were experienced soldiers; all our previous experience had been in
attack; it was something new this feeling that a powerful, energetic,
determined foe was beating down our opposition and getting nearer and
nearer. Yet, whatever they may have felt, not one of our little band
showed signs of depression or nervous excitement. The
signalling-sergeant was cursing the sanitary orderly for not having
cleared up a particular litter of tins and empty cigarette packets;
the officers' cook was peeling potatoes for dinner, and I heard the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>old wheeler singing softly to himself some stupid, old-time,
music-hall ditty.</p>

<p>In the mess no one spoke a word, but each of us knew that our one
thought was whether A battery would be able to hold out.</p>

<p>5.30 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: The answer, a grim and saddening one. A sergeant
came hurrying in.</p>

<p>"They've captured the battery, sir," he said bluntly, "and Major
Harville is killed. I came to report, sir. I was the only one to get
away."</p>

<p>I think sometimes of famous cases of tragedy and passion I have heard
unfolded at the Old Bailey and the Law Courts, and the intense, almost
theatrical atmosphere surrounding them, and compare it to the simple
setting of this story, told in matter-of-fact tones by a sergeant
standing to attention. "We finished all our ammunition, sir," he
began, addressing the colonel, "and took our rifles. Major Harville
was shot by a machine-gun while he was detailing us to defend the two
gun-pits farthest from the place where the enemy had got past our
wire. He fell into my gun-pit, sir, shot in the head. Mr Dawes, who
took command, said we would keep on with rifles, and Bombardier
Clidstone was doing fine work with his Lewis gun. The Huns didn't seem
inclined to come close, and after a conference in my gun-pit with Mr
Bliss, Mr Dawes asked for a volunteer to try and find the nearest
infantry, and to tell them we'd hold on if they could engage the enemy
and prevent him rushing us. I said I would try, and crawled on my
belly, sir, through the grass to an empty trench. The battery fired
several fine volleys; I heard them for a long time. It was slow work
crawling away without being seen, and when I had got 600 yards and was
trying to get my bearing&mdash;I don't know what time it was.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>"Then I noticed that no firing came from the battery. There was no
sound at all for over ten minutes. Then about a hundred Germans rushed
forward and started bombing the gun-pits, and some of our men came up.
I saw about a dozen of them marched off as prisoners."</p>

<p>"You are quite sure Major Harville was killed?" asked the colonel
quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; he fell right in my gun-pit."</p>

<p>We all stood silent, looking on the ground. Poor Harville! The phrase
that kept running in my mind was, "One of the best," but with a
different meaning to that in which generally it is used. A gallant
upright soul. The very best type of the civilian soldier who fought
this war for England. Before the war a professional man who had given
no thought to fighting: when he became a soldier it was because he
understood thoroughly, and believed in completely, all that for which
he was ready to give his life.</p>

<p>A clean-living, truly religious man too, who loathed loose talk and
swearing, and lived up to his ideals even amid the slime and filth of
war. And his bravery was that of the honest man who fears and yet
faces danger, not the bull-headed heroism of the "man who knows no
fear." Poor Harville!</p>

<p>The sergeant spoke again.</p>

<p>"Before I came back here, sir, after the enemy had marched off our
men, B Battery turned their guns on the Germans in A Battery's
position."</p>

<p>"Did they?" said the colonel, his face lighting up. "Splendid!"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; they fired well, a hundred rounds, I should think. They
scattered all the Germans, sir: they ran like mad."</p>

<p>We had given up hope of ever hearing again of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>two sniping guns
sited just behind the original front line, C's 18-pdr. and D's 4&middot;5
how. They were at least 2000 yards in front of the ill-fated A
Battery, and must have been captured. What was our surprise then to
note the arrival, at a slow easy walk, of the sergeant of D Battery
who had been in charge of the 4&middot;5 howitzer. He reported that the
detachments had come away safely at 5.45 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>, and before
doing so had "spiked" both guns, and so left their enemy useless
booty. It was such an orderly account of action, taken strictly
according to drill-book procedure, that I have pieced it together in
this form:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block2"><p class="hang">2.30 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> A few shells falling.</p>

<p class="hang">4.30 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> Intense hostile bombardment begun. Officer at
O.P. ordered detachments to man guns.</p>

<p class="hang">4.32 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> Fired on two targets on orders from O.P.</p>

<p class="hang">Noon. Communication with O.P. broke down.</p>

<p class="hang">12.30 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> Attempt to mend O.P. wire failed, as it was
too badly cut by shell fire.</p>

<p class="hang">1 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> The sergeant of D Battery went away to try and
discover the situation and to obtain orders.</p>

<p class="hang">2 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> The sergeant found the men in neighbourhood of
O.P. Officer obviously killed or a prisoner. Enemy troops also
along road leading to battery positions where officers could be
found. Returned to "sniping" howitzer.</p>

<p class="hang">4.30 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> The sergeant then endeavoured to get in touch
with the infantry, and to obtain orders from them. He found none
of our own infantry, but a machine-gun officer directed him to
hold on as long as he could. He returned again, and discovering
Germans close to the 18-pdr. and the 4&middot;5 howitzer, ordered the
detachments to open fire on them with rifles. The enemy were
dispersed after ten minutes' shooting.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>5.45 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> The two detachments came away, first blowing up
the 4&middot;5 how. and removing the breech mechanism, dial sight, and
sight clinometer of the 18-pdr. As soon as he had vacated the
position the sergeant reported to the machine-gun officer and
then to his battery's rear position.</p></div>

<p>"That's the way to carry on war," exclaimed the colonel when the
sergeant had saluted and departed: "A stout fellow that!"</p>

<p>The reports from Divisional Artillery and from the Infantry Brigade
with whom we were in liaison showed that the Hun was still coming on
to the left and the right of us. Directly in front of us he seemed
quiescent, but our orders were to get over the canal after nightfall.
The colonel dictated orders for the batteries to me, and then said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I want you to get a telephone line out from here over the canal. The
batteries will come into action behind the railway embankment." He
indicated the positions on the map. "I'm going to keep an officer at B
Battery's rear O.P. until the last moment, and the line must run from
him to here and thence over the canal to the batteries in their new
positions. You quite understand? I shall stay with General &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; (the
infantry brigadier) and cross the canal with him. Leave me one
telephonist. We'll have dinner and get the kit and the mess cart back
to the waggon lines; and you'd better get your line out immediately
after dinner."</p>

<p>These orders were clear enough. We dined comfortably, and by 8
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> all the waggons, save the mess cart, were ready to move
out of the quarry.</p>

<p>As I stepped out of the mess to see that arrangements were complete
the regimental sergeant-major <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>approached me, saying: "They say the
strong point at &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; (about 600 yards away) has fallen, sir. We're
quite ready to move, sir!"</p>

<p>A voice behind me, the colonel's: "Put a stop at once to such a
ridiculous, panicky rumour. The next man who repeats it is to be put
under arrest."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when the telephone bell rang and I went inside the mess
to answer it, the infantry brigade-major's high-pitched voice said in
quick sharp tones: "The strong point has just been carried by the
enemy. You'd better be clearing out of your quarry."</p>

<h3>IV. THE NIGHT OF MARCH 21<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>Something that aroused anger, recrimination, and some amusement
occurred during our night evacuation of the quarry. Officers' and
men's kit, the signalling outfit, the doctor's medical stores, and the
cook's stove and kitchen utensils, had been packed. The sergeant-major
had a final hunt round, and then gave the order "Walk march!" The G.S.
waggon, drawn by six D.A.C. mules, set off at regulation pace, the
mess cart drawn by Minnie, the fat roan, followed with due sedateness;
and then, hang me! if the pole of the Maltese cart didn't snap in two.
Old-soldier resource and much hard swearing failed to make it a
workable vehicle. Worse still, it was this cart that contained the
officers' kit, including the colonel's. It was pitch-dark, and the
advancing enemy not more than a thousand yards away.</p>

<p>I wasn't there at that exact moment, but I believe the sergeant-major
blamed the size of our "on leave" adjutant's spare kit for the
breakdown. "A valise and a half, two bags and a portmanteau&mdash;enough
for three people," he growled. An attempt was made to get our kit away
by adding to the load on the G.S. waggon, but that made it altogether
too top-heavy; and after ten minutes of sweating and shouting the
sergeant-major told the drivers to move off, leaving the wrecked
Maltese cart and the officers' kit behind. That was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>how I found
it&mdash;on the ground&mdash;when, having received final instructions from the
colonel for linking up the batteries by telephone as soon as they took
up new positions on the other side of the canal, I came out of the
mess. The colonel's servant stood by, looking angrily at the abandoned
kit; and the sergeant-major, now on his horse, was saying he would try
to borrow a cart from one of the batteries and get the stuff over the
canal at any rate.</p>

<p>"Get away as soon as you can," I interrupted, "and bring back the
first cart you unload at the waggon lines. You've got to get the
Maltese cart away as well. Two of the servants will stay behind to
help load up when you return. And look sharp if you don't want the
Boche to be here first."</p>

<p>A squadron of Yeomanry, with picks and shovels, were lining up in
front of the quarry as I came away with three of the signallers. It
was extremely dark, there was a dampness in the air that suggested
rain, some Boche howitzers were firing over our heads across the
canal, and a steady "putt-puttr-putt-putt" in the direction of the
strong point, that less than half an hour ago had fallen, told of a
machine-gun duel in progress. It was not an inspiriting moment; and
over us, like a pall, lay an atmosphere of doubt and apprehension,
that lack of knowledge of what was really happening only added to.</p>

<p>But at such moments there's nothing so steadying to mind and senses as
something definite to do. Earlier on I had noted marked on a Corps
signalling-map a test-box between the quarry and the canal and another
one along the railway embankment, not far from the retiring positions
assigned to the batteries. If we could find them the labour of laying
an overland telephone wire <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>from the quarry to the opposite side of
the canal would be saved. We set out, got off the roadway, and did a
good deal of floundering about in hedge-bottoms and over waste lands;
but the important thing was that we found both test-boxes, and that
the buried cables we hoped for were there.</p>

<p>10.30 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: I had reeled out my lines alongside the railway
from the test-box to D Battery and to C and A, who, because of the
nine guns the brigade had lost in the morning, had become a composite
battery. They had crossed the canal in comparative quiet and were now
laying out lines of fire by compass bearings. B Battery were coming
along to a spot near the railway farther north, and my signallers were
waiting to connect them up. Things were indeed getting ship-shape
again. I had spoken through to the colonel and put him in touch with
his battery commanders, and to the F.O.O. left at the rearmost O.P. on
the eastern side of the canal. The colonel had issued a night-firing
programme just as if we were in settled positions, and with fresh
ammunition arriving from the original waggon lines the batteries began
"pooping off" with brisk enthusiasm, their object being, of course, to
cover the retirement of our infantry.</p>

<p>Every one of us had turned out that morning immediately the Hun
bombardment started. No sleep could be looked for that night either;
but there was the morrow, March 22nd, to be reckoned with&mdash;it might
entail even more wear and tear than the day which was ending; so I
sent back to the waggon lines all but six of the signallers, the
brigade clerks, the two wireless operators, who had nothing whatever
to do, and most of the servants, telling them to get as much sleep as
possible. The colonel's servant was still in the quarry guarding our
castaway kit; my own servant I had stationed on <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>the canal bridge so
that he could report to me as soon as the sergeant-major and the
rescuing waggon hove in sight.</p>

<p>Our discovery of the buried cable running under the canal had a sequel
equally welcome. One of the telephone linemen said he believed there
was another "bury" on the far side of the railway cutting, and that it
connected with the back areas. The signalling-sergeant and myself set
out on another hunt, and, joy! we discovered, after patient test calls
with a D.III. telephone, that by speaking through two exchanges we
could communicate with our own Divisional H.Q. It was six hundred
yards from the railway cutting, but I could now keep in touch with the
colonel in front, the batteries to right and left of me along the
railway, and the brigadier-general and the brigade-major in rear.</p>

<p>1 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: My work for the moment was complete and I could take
it easy. I stood outside the test-box that had become a sort of
Brigade H.Q. and listened to the waspish crack of our 18-pdrs. sending
defiance to the enemy. The six signallers&mdash;plus a terrier&mdash;had crowded
into the tiny sandbag shelter that protected the test-box. One of
them, receiver to ear, waited for calls, a candle stuck on an inverted
mess-tin shedding sufficient light for the pencilling of messages. The
others sprawled in cramped positions, snuggled one against another for
warmth, and sought sleep. The doings of the Boche seemed more puzzling
than ever. What was happening on the other side of the canal? Five
hours ago he had captured a strong post within 1800 yards of the spot
on which I now stood, and we had no reserve lines of infantry in front
of him. Why this strange quiescence? And then my mind took another
turn. What had become of the sergeant-major with the waggon that was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>to gather up our left kit? Why did he take such a long time? I thought
bitterly of my field boots, and the British warm I was beginning to
want, and the new jacket and breeches, all in my valise. Why hadn't I
put on my best pair of leggings to come away in? The Boche would have
been welcome to the older ones I was wearing; besides, they didn't fit
so well as the pair left in the quarry.</p>

<p>The little American doctor suddenly nipped my elbow. I had missed him
during the last two hours. "Say, son," he said, "come and take a walk
along the line: I've happened on a hut down along there with a fire in
it. Belongs to some sappers. Come and take a warm."</p>

<p>"Can't," I replied, shaking my head; "I'd like to, but I shall have to
be like the Boy who stood on the Burning Deck to-night. I must stop on
this spot until the colonel comes across."</p>

<p>The doctor toddled off, and I got the telephonist to ring through to
the colonel. "The enemy seems to be waiting. He's not troubling our
infantry," he informed me, and then added, "Has the kit been got away
from the quarry yet?"</p>

<p>I made sure that the telephonist was ringing up each battery every ten
minutes to see that the lines were in working order, and then climbed
up the railway bank and walked over to inquire if the brigade-major
had any news. He hadn't. "And try and keep in touch with us on this
line," he added. "It's the only way we have at the moment of speaking
to your Brigade."</p>

<p>2 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: The best news of the night. The sergeant-major had
crossed the bridge. Our precious kit would be borne to safety! At 3.15
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> he passed again, triumphant, the Maltese cart in tow as
well. Hurrah! Let the war now proceed!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>At 4.30 the colonel telephoned that the infantry brigadier and himself
were about to cross the canal. The telephone wire could be cut, and I
was to meet him at the railway bridge in twenty minutes' time.</p>

<p>"The infantry are crossing the canal at six o'clock," he said when he
rode up and called my name through the mist. "Batteries will start to
withdraw to their next positions at 6.30. Each battery will withdraw a
section (two guns) at a time; and the last section must not pull out
until the preceding section is in action at the new position." He gave
me the map co-ordinates of the new positions, and rode off to visit
the battery commanders.</p>

<p>6 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: Extraordinary, it was to be another rainless hazy
morning. How the weather always assists the Boche! In the grey gloom
on top of the embankment I could see forms moving&mdash;our own infantry,
marching steadily, neither cheerful nor depressed, just moving,
impersonal forms. "What's happened?" I asked a subaltern, keeping time
with him as he marched.</p>

<p>"We're going back to Rouez Wood," he answered. "The Westshires are
lining up now behind the canal."</p>

<p>"Are they going to hold it?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Don't know," was the reply; "only know our orders."</p>

<p>"Had many casualties?" I asked again.</p>

<p>"No! only a few from snipers. We weren't in the counter-attack."</p>

<p>They swung round and passed over the railway bridge, making west. On
the bridge stood a keen-eyed, small-featured sapper major. I talked to
him.</p>

<p>"No!" he informed me, "there's no intention of making a stand here.
We've blown up all the canal bridges except one." A muffled boom! "Ah,
there goes the last one. All our infantry are over by now."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>A few German 4&middot;2's were coming over now, mostly on the western side of
the railway cutting. They helped to put a bit of ginger into the
withdrawal of the guns. A section of each battery had now pulled out;
the teams "walked out," crossing the bridge and heading down the road.
There was no trotting. The batteries went out heads high.</p>

<p>7 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: On the telephone I learned that the last two sections
were waiting the arrival of mounted orderlies to tell them to pull
out. Right! I disconnected the wires, told the signallers to report to
B Battery where I would pick them up, and not to waste time getting
there. Then I sought a copse on the other side of the bridge, where I
knew my horses would be waiting.</p>

<p>The sentry and the sappers who waited to blow up the bridge remained
at their posts silent and still. Forty yards after passing them I was
alone. I stopped in the road and turned to look back. The sun was
breaking through the mist, but it was a mournful landscape&mdash;dull,
soulless. All at once I felt chilled and tired, and for the first time
my thoughts turned seriously and intently towards what the
newly-arrived day had in store for myself, for the Brigade, for
England.</p>

<p>From the other side of the canal the "putt-puttr-putt" of
machine-guns! I turned westwards and went in search of my horses.</p>

<h3>V. A GUNNER'S V.C.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>Not even on this twenty-second of March did we realise fully the vast
conception and the extent of the German swoop, and that our Brigade
was as jetsam and as flotsam carried along on the mightiest part of
the storm flood.</p>

<p>7.30 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: The last sections of our batteries to pull out
from behind the railway embankment passed me on the road, the horses
walking grandly, the men tired but in high enough spirits. The enemy
long-range guns were waking up now and playing a damnable tattoo on
the main routes leading west. I saw one limber-waggon belonging to the
Engineers blown sky-high, and three maimed horses had to be shot.</p>

<p>At the cross-roads east of the wood behind which the batteries were
retiring I came upon the colonel, his overcoat buttoned up, his face
pallid with sleeplessness; but his mood was one for overriding
difficulties. He rode beside me awhile, and then pulled up,
exclaiming, "Let's have a cup of tea to start the day with.
Laneridge"&mdash;to his groom&mdash;"bring my Thermos flask."</p>

<p>"The first thing for you to do," he went on, as we drank tea and
munched ration biscuits, a few of which wise folk always slip into
their pockets when things are a-doing out here, "is to get wires out
to the batteries again. Headquarters will be at Rouez. Division have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>gone back to where &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; Corps were yesterday, and we take over their
quarters."</p>

<p>"What's the view of things at Infantry Headquarters, sir?" I asked as
we mounted again.</p>

<p>"Well, they blame the mist for the enemy getting past the outposts.
Most of the machine-guns they camouflaged with so much trouble never
came into the picture. But for some reason or other the Boche didn't
follow up. Perhaps he was waiting for reserves, or perhaps he got
suspicious. Our infantry didn't suffer many casualties, and I'm sure
the enemy didn't. We retired according to schedule time, and things
were quite quiet when I crossed the canal at four o'clock this
morning.</p>

<p>"Extraordinary attitude of mind some of the men out here nowadays
have," he proceeded. "Last night they brought in one of the &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;'s,
who was captured by the Boche in the morning but escaped and got back
to the battalion. He said that the enemy set prisoners bringing
ammunition up to their front line. When he was asked how he escaped,
he said that a shell killed 'the man-in-charge' of the party and he
got away. 'The man-in-charge,'" repeated the colonel. "He spoke as if
the Boche N.C.O. were a sort of foreman, and as if bringing up
ammunition which was to be shot at your own countrymen was the most
ordinary thing in the world."</p>

<p>Two high-velocity shells whizzed above our heads, and the colonel's
mare plunged excitedly. The enemy were evidently "stoking up" for a
fresh effort. We trotted on and toured the batteries, the colonel
inspecting the O.P.'s from which our fire was to be directed, and
ascertaining whether there was difficulty in keeping ammunition supply
up to 300 rounds per gun. When we <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>reached the Brigade Headquarters
horse lines, I instructed the sergeant-major to turn out the telephone
waggon in readiness to lay lines to the new battery positions. Then
breakfast&mdash;steaming tea and sizzling fried eggs and bacon cooked to
the minute. Nothing like being out all night for galvanising the
breakfast appetite. And no time for lingering afterwards. A canter
along the roadside to catch up the telephone cart; then, while the
signalling-sergeant, a good fellow who could read a map, reeled out
lines through the wood to the batteries, I undertook a tussle with the
terminal boards in the huge and elaborate dug-out telephone exchange,
that up to 5 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> had been the chief exchange of the whole
Division. Now that Divisional Headquarters had been established where
Corps Headquarters had been the day before, four miles back, there had
to be a re-allotment of lines to Infantry, Artillery, Engineers,
A.S.C., and the other units that work out the will of the Divisional
Commander.</p>

<p>"I'll get young Bushman down from B Battery to do signalling-officer
to-morrow. It will be difficult for you to do adjutant and
signalling-officer as well," remarked the colonel two hours later, as
he bent over his maps.</p>

<p>3 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: A R.H.A. brigade had put in a claim for the quarters
destined for us. Three days ago this would have resulted in polite
recrimination and telephoned appeals to higher authorities, but
to-day, such is the effect of mobile warfare, we all managed to dig in
somehow. A decent hut for the colonel had been found, and there was a
room in a bomb-mauled cottage, where the doctor, "Swiffy," the
veterinary officer, and myself hoped to spread our camp-beds. We had
shaved and washed and lunched, and looked and felt respectable again.
The C.R.A. and the brigade-major had called and gone off <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>with the
colonel to see the batteries shoot. I had forwarded by despatch-rider
the Brigade return of casualties to the staff captain, so that
reinforcements might be applied for forthwith. A French pointer of
confiding disposition, who came into the mess from nowhere in
particular, seemed quite to have made up his mind that we were come to
stay.</p>

<p>The telephone bell! The brigade-major of our companion Infantry
Brigade, with the latest news! "He's not crossed the canal on our
front yet, and your guns are doing good work keeping him back. But
he's got farther forward than we expected north of us. It's from the
south that we want more news. There's a report that we have been
pushed out of Tergnier. That's very bad, if true."</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later he rang up again. "There's a report that
enemy infantry are massing in Z 23 d 5.8. Can you turn your guns on to
'em?" I looked at the map co-ordinates he had given, and rang through
to the batteries.</p>

<p>4.30 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: Pretty definite signs now that the enemy was
coming on. A 5&middot;9 had made a hole a hundred yards from where
Headquarter horse lines had been staked out. Another had crashed among
the trees that sheltered our mess, and a branch, after being jerked
yards high in the air, had fallen plunk through the cook's bed. And
they were not long-range shells either. Also, there had been seven
shots from the most wicked, the most unsettling weapon in the Hun
armoury&mdash;the 4&middot;2 high-velocity gun, that you don't hear until it is
past you, so to speak. One shell grazed the top of the office in which
the doctor and myself were sitting; another snapped off a tree-trunk
like&mdash;well, as a 4&middot;2 does snap off a tree-trunk. Most ominous sign of
all&mdash;when the seven shots <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>had been fired, three ugly-looking holes
ringed themselves round the colonel's hut. Next, a Hun aeroplane, with
irritating sauciness, circled above our camp, not more than five
hundred feet up. Our "Archies" made a lot of noise, and enjoyed their
customary success: the Hun airman sailed calmly back to his own lines.</p>

<p>6 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: The adjutant of the R.H.A. Brigade came in to tell me
that the enemy were getting closer, and that the break-through on our
right admitted of no doubt. I despatched written orders to the battery
waggon lines for gun teams and limbers to be brought up to within a
thousand yards of the guns.</p>

<p>7 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: The colonel was back. A battery that had only reached
France three days before had been put under his command, to compensate
for the loss of seven guns from A and C batteries. It was getting
dark, but the officers at the O.P.'s in front of the wood were still
able to pick up moving targets, and many Germans were being accounted
for.</p>

<p>The colonel found time to mention more episodes of the March
Twenty-first fighting. "Every bridge over the canal was blown up by
6.30 this morning," he said; "but, do you know that D Battery's cook,
who had got left behind last night, and seems to have wandered about a
good deal, did not come over until nine o'clock this morning? No
wonder we retired in comfort."</p>

<p>The brigadier had told him more of what had happened to the &nbsp;&mdash;rd, our
companion Divisional Artillery Brigade. "Their C Battery put up a
wonderful fight&mdash;got infantry and trench mortars to help, and didn't
come away until 10 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>, after putting their guns out of
action. One gunner did extraordinarily stout work. Unaided, and with a
rifle, he held up a Boche machine-gun party that had worked round on
the battery's left <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>flank, and later, with three others, captured the
machine-gun. One Boche, who broke through, he chased over half the
country apparently, and shot him down. The amusing thing is that when
he had killed the Boche he searched his pockets, and found a cake,
addressed to a bombardier in another battery. The Huns had scuppered
this battery and ransacked their dug-outs. The bombardier was somewhat
surprised last night when the gunner handed him his lost cake."</p>

<p>This was a gunner who eventually was awarded the highest honour a
soldier can win.</p>

<p>8 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: A dinner much disturbed by German artillery. They
started a tremendous shelling of the wood in which we were encamped.
Salvos of 5&middot;9's made deafening crashes among the trees, and the earth
was shaken by the heavier, more awe-inspiring "crump" of the 8-inch
how. There was now, too, a steady bombardment of Villequier Aumont,
the village, a mile and a half behind, in which the battery waggon
lines had been installed.</p>

<p>The colonel came to a rapid decision. "They'll make Villequier Aumont
and the wood too hot for waggon lines to-night," he remarked. "We'll
move them at once to the other side of Villequier Aumont. Dump them on
the roadside. You'd better go and see it carried out. Leave me two
cycle orderlies, and I'll stay with the Infantry Brigade. They have a
mined dug-out here."</p>

<p>So, for the second time in twenty-four hours, we did a night
retirement. Infantry were coming back along the road, and big shells
were falling at regular intervals.</p>

<p>Any amount of retreating traffic on the other side of Villequier
Aumont, but no signs of panic or confusion. A block caused by supply
lorries coming from the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>opposite direction threatened to hold up some
ambulance cars, but it was only momentary. Our little American doctor
did good work here, galloping off to halt the supply lorries and
raising Cain until the traffic sorted itself out.</p>

<p>I selected a field near the roadside for Headquarter waggon lines. A
stream ran conveniently by. The horses were watered and fed; our
Headquarter notice-board was duly affixed to a roadside tree; and the
doctor added to his previous achievement by tying a tarpaulin to the
side of the mess cart, so that "Swiffy," the doctor himself, and
myself had shelter when we lay down.</p>

<p>The moon rose glorious, serene; there was no need for candles to light
us to bed. We slept heavily, too tired to worry about the morrow, or
the menacing drone of Hun 'planes overhead.</p>

<h3>VI. BEHIND VILLEQUIER AUMONT<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>I have tried to explain how "this flood-burst of moving war, such as
the world had never before seen," affected one unit of the R.F.A., and
one unimportant civilian soldier who was doing adjutant; how the
immensity and swift thoroughness of the German effort must have been
realised by the casual newspaper reader in England more quickly than
by the average officer or man who had to fight against it.</p>

<p>5.30 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: That six hours' sleep under a tarpaulin did me all
the good in the world, and by 5 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> I was out seeing that
our Headquarter horses were being groomed and fed and got ready for
immediate action.</p>

<p>The guns were particularly quiet, and I remember thinking: we have
retreated eight miles in forty-eight hours&mdash;it's about time we
stopped. Something is sure to be doing farther north, where we are so
much stronger.</p>

<p>Breakfast and a shave; then a move forward to find the colonel, and to
learn whether he wanted the waggon lines brought up again. It was a
lovely morning. A beautiful stretch of meadowland skirted the road
leading back to Villequier Aumont, and my horse cantered as if the
buoyancy of spring possessed him also. I caught up Fentiman of D
Battery, who said he was shifting his waggon lines back to Villequier
Aumont. "The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>water and the standings are so much better there," he
said.</p>

<p>I found the colonel standing in the square at Villequier Aumont,
watching the departure by car of the three American ladies who for a
month past had dispensed tea and cakes in the gaily-painted maisonette
at the top of the village. They had been the first harbingers of the
approaching brotherhood between the British and American Armies in
this part of the Front: brave hospitable women, they had made many
friends.</p>

<p>The colonel was not in such good mood this morning. He had remained
through the night with the infantry brigadier in the wood from which
our horse lines had withdrawn the previous evening. The dug-out was
none too large, and his only rest had been a cramped four hours trying
to sleep on the floor. With no rest at all the night before, no wonder
he looked fagged. But immediately there were orders to give, he became
his usual alert, clear-headed self. "It is most important this morning
that we should keep communication with our Divisional Artillery
Headquarters," he began. "Bring the telephone cart back to the wood at
once, and put a couple of telephonists into the dug-out. They'll be
safe there until the last possible moment. It's uncertain yet whether
we're going to hold the enemy up there or not."</p>

<p>I galloped back and brought the telephone cart along at a trot. The
two wheelers, particularly "the doctor's mare," stepped out in most
refreshing style. "The old cart's never had such a day since it's been
to France," grinned the signalling-sergeant when we pulled up. Odd
5&middot;9's were falling in the wood; our batteries had shifted in the early
morning from the eastern side of the wood to positions more
north-west, and two Horse <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>Artillery batteries were moving up behind
the rise that protected our right flank. But what was this? Coming up
at a steady march, bayonets glinting, a long column of blue-grey wound
into view. French infantry! The thin line of khaki was at last to
receive support!</p>

<p>7 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: The Infantry battle was now developing sharply two
thousand yards in front of us. Shells crashed persistently into the
wood; the "putt-puttr-putt" of machine-guns rattled out
ceaselessly.... Whimsically I recalled quieter days on the Somme, when
our machine-gunners used to loose off seven rounds in such a way as to
give a very passable imitation of that popular comic-song tag,
"Umtiddy-om-pom&mdash;Pom-pom!" After three attempts we had given up trying
to keep telephone touch with the batteries, and I had detailed mounted
orderlies to be in readiness. One line I kept going, though, between
the hut where the infantry brigadier and his brigade-major and the
colonel received messages describing the progress of the fighting, and
the telephone dug-out, whence the colonel could be switched on to the
artillery brigadier. There was bad news of the battery just out from
England that had come under the colonel's command the evening before.
Three of their guns had been smashed by direct hits, and they had lost
horses as well. The Boche were swarming over the canal now, and our A
and C and B Batteries were firing over open sights and cutting up
Germans as they surged towards our trenches.</p>

<p>11 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: Orders from our own brigadier to pull out the guns
and retire to a crest behind Villequier Aumont. I heard the news come
along the telephone wire, and went through the wood to seek further
directions from <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>the colonel. It was evident now that the wood could
only be held at great sacrifice, and by determined hand-to-hand
fighting. The Boche outnumbered us by at least four to one, and French
help had not yet arrived in sufficient strength. I walked behind two
rows of French and British infantry, lying ready in shallow newly-dug
trenches. They looked grave and thoughtful; some of them had removed
their tunics. I remember noting that of four hundred men I passed not
one was talking to his neighbour. I remember noticing a few horses
waiting behind, and motor-cyclist messengers hurriedly arriving and
hurriedly departing. I remember most of all the mournful, desolate
howling of a dog, tied up to one of the now deserted huts&mdash;the poor
friendly French pointer who the day before had snuggled his nose into
my hand. Near the hedge leading to the hut where I should find the
colonel stood a group of infantry officers. One of them, a tall
lieutenant-colonel, I recognised as Colonel &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; who had dined with us
in our mess in the quarry a few nights before the offensive started.
His head was heavily bandaged. I learned some days afterwards that he
had been wounded while leading a company of his battalion in a
counter-attack; and that not long after I passed him that morning in
the wood he reorganised and exhorted his men, facing terrific rifle
and machine-gun fire&mdash;and indeed showed such glorious and inspiring
courage that he gained the Victoria Cross.</p>

<p>1 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: The mounted orderlies had delivered orders to the
batteries to retire, and D Battery was already trekking along the road
the other side of Villequier Aumont. Machine-gun fire in the wood we
had left was hotter than ever. And the German guns were moving up, as
could be told when long-range efforts began to be made <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>on the
villages behind Villequier Aumont. Half a dozen high-velocity shells
struck the road we had traversed, one of them knocking out a Horse
Artillery waggon and three horses. Two other horses had to be shot,
and the sixth bolted. From the markings on a good horse that I found
tied to our own lines later in the day, I concluded that the runaway
had strayed in our direction; and in the matter of strayed
horses&mdash;good horses, that is&mdash;the sergeant-major always worked on the
principle, "It's all in the same firm." At any rate, we had a valuable
spare horse for the trying march that followed.</p>

<p>2.30 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: The colonel had selected the new positions for the
batteries, and two of them were already in. While we waited the
arrival of the others, we flung ourselves down in a hay-field and
watched the now continuous stream of men, batteries, transport
lorries, and ambulance cars coming up the hill leading from Villequier
Aumont, and toiling past us towards Ugny. There was no doubting it
now: it was a retreat on a big scale.</p>

<p>All round us were rolling fields, rich of soil, and tilled and tended
with that French care and thoroughness that the war has intensified.
Even small irregular patches at road-crossings have been cultivated
for the precious grain these last two years. "The Boche will get all
this, curse him!" muttered the colonel.</p>

<p>Major Bullivant of B Battery came over the hill on the pet grey mare
that, in spite of three changes from one Division to another, he had
managed to keep with him all the time he had been in France. He didn't
dismount in drill-book fashion; he just fell off. It was spirit, not
physique, that was keeping him going. Unshaven, wild-eyed, dirty, he
probably didn't know it. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>His mind centred on nothing but the business
in hand. "My battery is coming through Villequier Aumont now, sir," he
informed the colonel. "For a few minutes I was afraid we weren't going
to get out. My damn fool of a sergeant-major, for some reason or
other, took the gun-teams back to the waggon lines this morning. Said
he was going to change them and bring fresh teams up after breakfast
or something. When Beadle came up with the teams we were under
machine-gun fire. Got one man killed and three wounded, and we have a
few scratches on the shields.... If I don't get up, sir, I shall fall
fast asleep," he exclaimed suddenly. "Where are our new positions,
sir?"</p>

<p>The colonel handed him his flask, and he smiled. "As a matter of fact,
sir, I've kept going on ration rum."</p>

<p>When the colonel and Major Bullivant went off, up rode Beadle in an
extraordinary get-up: British warm, gum-boots, and pyjamas. He had
been able to get no change since the Boche 8-inch had wiped out B
Battery's mess at the opening of the Hun bombardment on the 21st. It
was an amazing thing, but neither of us had remembered to eat anything
since breakfast until that moment. The day's excitements had caused us
to ignore time altogether, and to forget hunger. But Beadle's tired
grin brought me back to such worldly matters, and we fell to on a tin
of bully and a hunk of cheese that the signalling-sergeant discovered
for us.</p>

<p>"They say we've done jolly well up north," said Beadle, his mouth
full. "Got as far as Cambrai, and 25,000 prisoners taken at Ypres."</p>

<p>"Who told you that?" I asked, at the same time ready to believe. Did
not this entirely support my belief of the early morning? Certainly we
must be doing something up north!</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>"I heard it at the waggon lines," went on Beadle. "They say it's in
Corps orders."</p>

<p>The line of retreating traffic and of loaded ambulance cars in front
of us maintained its monotonous length. But the retirement continued
to be orderly and under full control, although now and again a block
in the next village kept the main road lined with immobile horses and
men, while high-velocity shells, directed at the road, whizzed
viciously to right and left of them. One kilted Scot passed us leading
a young cow. He paid no heed to the jests and the noisy whistling of
"To be a Farmer's Boy" that greeted him. "The milk 'ull be a' richt
the morn's morn, ye ken," was his comfortable retort. And once a
red-headed Yorkshireman broke the strain of the wait under shell-fire
by calling out, "It's a good job we're winnin'!"</p>

<p>The colonel came back after showing Major Bullivant his new battery
position, and told me to ride off at once to Ugny, where Divisional
Artillery Headquarters had stationed themselves, and inform the staff
captain that the ammunition dump on the roadside contained no
ammunition. "Find out something definite," he ordered.</p>

<p>D.A. had settled themselves in two rooms in a deserted house, and the
staff captain quickly sketched out the arrangements he had made for
ammunition supply. "A Divisional ammunition column is too cumbersome
for this moving warfare," he said, "and your Brigade will be supplied
by No. 1 section acting as B.A.C. There's an ammunition park at &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;,
and if you will supply guides here (pointing to the map) at 6.30
to-night, your B.A.C. will supply direct to your waggon lines. And
that arrangement will continue so long as we are conducting this sort
of warfare. Is that clear?... Right!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>As I was about to depart, in came the brigade-major, who had been in
consultation with the brigadier-general. "Ah, &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;," he said, calling
me by name, "you can give me some information. Is the colonel far
away?"</p>

<p>"He's with the batteries, sir, giving them targets from their new
positions."</p>

<p>"Right! Can you tell me how many guns you have in action now?"</p>

<p>I was able to do this, and also told him where our batteries were
going to establish waggon lines for the night.</p>

<p>"That won't do," he interrupted; "you'll be too far north. The Boche
is coming down that main road. You'd better tell the colonel that any
further retirement must be south-west, because the Boche is pinching
us on our left. I'll show you the line as it runs at present. I've
just got it."</p>

<p>We bent over his large-scale map, and I copied the curved line on to
my own map. "The French are properly in now," added the brigade-major,
"and we are going to fight for that line. There's to be no more
retiring."</p>

<p>"Is it true, sir, that we've done well up north? Most encouraging
rumours flying round."</p>

<p>"I don't know," he replied with a tired smile. "I hope so."</p>

<p>A smile and a cheering word from the General, who said, "I've just
seen the colonel, and I've put two of your batteries farther forward.
They'll help to hold Villequier Aumont a bit longer." Then outside I
met Beadle, and gave him the time and place where battery guides had
to meet the B.A.C. ammunition waggons, and sent off my groom to convey
this information officially to all the battery waggon lines. After
which I cantered <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>back, and discovered the colonel inspecting the two
batteries that the General had moved to more forward positions.</p>

<p>It was 6 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>, and the enemy advance machine-gun parties were
now certainly closing in on Villequier Aumont, which lay in the hollow
beneath us. But I shall always remember the handling of our composite
A and C batteries on that occasion. It so exactly fulfilled drill-book
requirements, it might all have been done on parade. The noses of the
four 18-pdrs. peeped out from under a clump of beeches, close to a
pond under the brow of a hill. Dumble had climbed to the top of a
tower three-quarters of a mile from the battery, and directed the
shooting from the end of a roughly laid telephone wire. He reported
only fleeting glimpses of Huns, but could guess pretty well the spots
at which they were congregating, and issued his orders accordingly.
Young Eames, the officer passing the orders to the gunners, stood very
upright, close to the battery telephonist, and let his voice ring out
in crisp staccato tones that would have won him full marks at Larkhill
or Shoeburyness: "Aiming point top of tower. All guns ... Four 0
degrees Right.... Concentrate Two 0 minutes on Number One....
Corrector 152.... Why didn't you shout out your Fuze Number 3?...
Three Two-fifty&mdash;Two Nine-fifty.... Will you acknowledge orders,
Sergeant Kyle?..."</p>

<p>The colonel, who was standing well behind Eames, smiled and said to
me, "Good young officer that. If he keeps as cool all the time, the
battery ought to shoot well."</p>

<p>Hun aeroplanes were beginning to come over. Trench war customs had
made it almost axiomatic that firing should cease when enemy aircraft
appeared. Three <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>times the battery stopped firing at the cry,
"Aeroplane up!"</p>

<p>The colonel intervened. "Don't stop because of aeroplanes now," he
said sharply. "We're fighting moving warfare, and the enemy haven't
time to concentrate all their attention on this battery."</p>

<p>7 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: The colonel and I walked slowly back to the roadway.
"I've sent back to Bushman, and told him to bring Headquarters waggon
lines up here," he said. "They are too far back the other side of
Ugny, and we're only a small unit: we can move more quickly than a
battery. We'll unhook on the side of that hill there, away from the
road. It will be quite warm to-night, and we can lie down under those
trees." ... A dozen or so 5&middot;9's rushed through the air, and burst with
terrifying ear-racking crashes along the road in front of us. A
charred, jagged rent showed in the wall of a farm building. Three
hundred yards farther along we saw the Headquarter vehicles drawn up
on the roadside. The drivers and the signallers were drinking tea, and
seemed to be preparing to settle for the night in a barn whose lofty
doors opened on to the road. "Look at those fellows," ejaculated the
colonel testily. "They're never happy unless they can stuff themselves
under a roof. Fetch 'em out, and tell 'em to pull up to the top of
that hill there. As long as you keep away from villages and marked
roads you can escape most of the shelling."</p>

<p>7.30 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: We had tied up the horses, and parked the G.S.
waggon and the telephone and mess carts. Twilight had almost merged
into night now, but the moon was rising, and it was to be another
amazingly lustrous moon. The cook had started a small log-fire to make
tea for the colonel, Bushman, and myself, and after that we <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>intended
to lie down and get some sleep. "Swiffy" and the doctor seemed to have
disappeared. Must be at one of the battery waggon lines, we concluded.</p>

<p>"While tea is getting ready, I'll walk down to D Battery again.
They're pretty close up to the infantry, and I want to make sure they
can get out easily if they have to make a rapid move," remarked the
colonel, and he disappeared over the hill, taking his servant with
him.</p>

<p>The kettle had not had time to boil. The colonel had only been away
ten minutes. The tired drivers were unrolling their blankets and
preparing for slumber. Suddenly my ear caught a voice calling up the
hillside&mdash;the colonel's&mdash;followed twice by the stentorian tones of his
servant.</p>

<p>The cry was, "Saddle-up!"</p>

<h3>VII. STILL IN RETREAT<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>8.15 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: "I found that D Battery had moved off&mdash;gone
towards the other side of Ugny, and A and C were also on the march,"
explained the colonel, when Headquarter carts and waggons&mdash;parked out
for the night only half an hour before&mdash;had again got under way
(taking the road between Villequier Aumont and Ugny) for the third
time during twenty-two hours. "Division got news that the Boche was
putting in two fresh divisions, and intended to attack by moonlight,"
he added, "and they thought our guns were too close up to be safe; so
the brigade-major hurried down and told the batteries to move back at
once. We turn south-west from Ugny and make for Commenchon, and come
into action there as soon as we get further news from Division. I have
sent out orders to all the batteries, and they are marching to
Commenchon independently."</p>

<p>It was a radiant night. The moon rode high in a star-spangled sky;
there was a glow and a sense of beauty in the air&mdash;a beauty that
exalted soul and mind, and turned one's thoughts to music and
loveliness and home. The dry hard roads glistened white and clean; and
in the silvery light the silhouettes of men marching steadily,
purposefully, took on a certain dignity that the garish sun had not
allowed to be revealed.</p>

<p>Whether we spoke of it or not, each one of us listened <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>expectantly
for the swift-rushing scream of a high-velocity shell, or the
long-drawn sough of an approaching 5&middot;9. This main road, along which
our retreating columns were winding their slow even way, was bound to
be strafed.</p>

<p>We rode through Ugny, two days ago a Corps H.Q., deserted now save for
the military police, and for odd parties of engineers, signallers, and
stretcher-bearers. Then our way took us down a wide sunken road,
through an undulating countryside that stretched up to remote
pine-tipped hills to right and left of us. A battalion of French
infantry had halted by the roadside; their voices, softer, more
tuneful than those of our men, seemed in keeping with the moonlit
scene; and in their long field-blue coats they somehow seemed bigger,
more matured, than our foot-soldiers.</p>

<p>We had marched five miles when a horseman on a broad-backed black came
towards us. He looked intently at every one he passed as he rode the
length of our column. "Is that the adjutant, sir?" he asked when he
came level with me; and then, sure of my identity, went on, "I've got
our supply waggon with me, sir&mdash;halted it at the next cross-roads. I
heard the Brigade was moving, sir, and came to find the best spot to
pick you up. The battery supply waggons will be passing this way in
about half an hour, sir."</p>

<p>Keeping daily touch with your supply column is one of the fine arts of
moving warfare, and the resourceful M'Donald had again proved his
worth. "Refilling point, to-morrow, will be at Bab&oelig;uf, sir," he
added, "and after to-morrow it will be only iron rations. Good forage
to-day, sir."</p>

<p>11 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: Brigade Headquarters had pulled into the right of
the road behind B Battery, just outside a village <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>that up to the 21st
had been a sort of rest-village, well behind the lines. Army Ordnance,
Army Service Corps, and battalions out of the line were the only units
represented there, and a fair proportion of the civil population had
re-established itself after the German retreat in the spring of 1917.
Now all was abandoned again, furniture and cattle bundled out, and
houses locked up in the hope that shortly the Boche would be thrust
back and the village re-occupied by its rightful owners.</p>

<p>The colonel had ridden forward with young Bushman to meet the
brigade-major and to settle where the Brigade would camp. More French
infantry passed, going up to the Front by the way we had come back.
Twice, big lasting flares illuminated the sky over there where the
fighting was&mdash;stores being burnt to prevent them falling into German
hands, we concluded. Presently, Bushman returned and pointed out a
particular area where Brigade Headquarters could settle down.</p>

<p>The small village green would do for horse lines and for parking our
vehicles. I sent off the sergeant-major to scout for water supply, and
took possession of a newly-roofed barn in which the men might sleep.
There was a roomy shed for the officers' horses and a stone outhouse
for the men's kitchen. Now about a billet for the colonel!</p>

<p>"There's a big house at the back, sir, with an artillery mess in it,"
said the sergeant-major, who had finished watering and feeding the
horses. "Perhaps there's a spare room there for the colonel."</p>

<p>I went round and came upon the officers of a 6-inch how. battery, who
had reached the village two hours before, and were finishing their
evening meal. They offered me dinner, which I refused, and then a
whisky, which I accepted; but there were no spare rooms. They <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>had got
away from the neighbourhood of the canal with the loss of two hows.,
but told me of a 9.2 battery at &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;, that it had been absolutely
impossible to get out. "I believe it is true that we've done very well
up north," replied their Irish captain cheerfully. "Lots of prisoners
at Ypres, they say.... Have another whisky!"</p>

<p>"We have one tent, haven't we?" I asked the sergeant-major when I got
outside.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, but there's a cottage where Meddings has put the officers'
cook-house. It looks all right, and there might be something there for
the colonel."</p>

<p>The cottage certainly looked clean and neat from the outside, but the
door was locked, and it is the rule that British troops only enter
French houses with the consent of the owners. However, I climbed
through the window and found two empty rooms each with bed and
mattress. Times were not for picking and choosing. "We'll put the tent
up," I decided, "and ask the colonel if he cares to take one of these
beds or have the tent. You and I, Bushman, will take what he doesn't
want."</p>

<p>When I took a turn round to see if the men were comfortably settled
for the night, I learnt that the skurried departure of the A.S.C. had
provided them with unexampled opportunity of legitimate loot. There
was one outbuilding crammed with blankets, shirts, socks, and
underwear&mdash;and our men certainly rose to the occasion. Even the old
wheeler chuckled when he discovered a brand-new saw and a drill. The
sergeant-major fastened on to a gramophone; and that caused me for the
first time to remember my Columbia graphophone that I had loaned to C
Battery before I went home wounded from Zillebeke. Hang it, it must
have been left behind at Villequier Aumont. The Germans had probably
got it by now.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>It was half-past twelve before the colonel returned. "I'll have my
camp-bed put up there," he said promptly, indicating an airy
cart-shed, and he refused altogether to look at the empty cottage. So
Bushman and I had beds made up in the tent, and then the three of us
sat down to a welcome and memorable <i>al fresco</i> supper opposite our
horse lines. Our table was a door balanced on a tree stump, and
Meddings provided a wonderful Lincolnshire pork-pie. He also managed
hot potatoes as an extra surprise, and as it was our first set meal
since 5.30 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> breakfast, there was a period of steady,
quiet, happy munching. One cigarette, then the colonel tucked himself
up in his valise, and in three minutes was deep in his first sleep for
three successive nights.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'm going to do," I said to Bushman when we got in
our tent. "I'm going to take my clothes off and put on pyjamas. You
never know these days when you'll get another chance."</p>

<p>I had pulled off my jacket, when I heard a jingling sound outside and
French voices. Looking out, I saw a couple of troops of French cavalry
picketing their tall leggy horses on the village green. I just had
time to rush out and prevent two troopers stabling their officers'
chargers in the cart-shed where the colonel was resting. They seemed
startled when I whispered that it was "mon colonel" who lay there, but
they apologised with the politeness of their race, and I pointed out a
much better stable higher up the street.</p>

<p>About 3 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> the piquet woke me to introduce an artillery
officer with a Caledonian accent, who asked if I could tell him where
a brigade I knew nothing at all about were quartered in the village.
The next thing I remember was the colonel's servant telling me the
colonel was up and wanted me immediately.</p>

<h3>VIII. A LAST FIFTY ROUNDS<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>5.30 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: "No orders have reached me from Division yet,"
said the colonel, shaving as he talked, his pocket mirror precariously
poised on a six-inch nail stuck in one of the props that held up the
roof of his cart-shed boudoir. "And I'm still waiting for reports from
A and D that they've arrived at the positions I gave them on the
orders sent out last night. I want you to go off and find the
batteries. I will wait here for orders from Division. Have your
breakfast first. You'll find the batteries somewhere along that
contour," pointing with the little finger of the hand that held the
safety razor to a 1/100,000th map on his bed.</p>

<p>Again I realised as I set out, followed by my groom, that the Boche
had moved forward during the night. The village we had occupied at 11
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> was now within range of his guns. Two 5&middot;9's dropped even
at that moment within 200 yards of our horses. Moreover, I hadn't
ridden far along the main street before I met some of our divisional
infantry. A company commander told me that the French had come through
and relieved them. His brigadier had arrived at Commenchon at 4
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>, and was lying down&mdash;in the white house at the corner.
"The Boche gave us no rest at all last night," he went on. "He'd got
two fresh divisions opposite us, and shoved up thousands of men after
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>ten o'clock. We killed hundreds of 'em, but there was no stopping
them. And aren't they hot with the machine-gun? They must have been
specially trained for this sort of warfare. They snipe you at 700
yards as if the machine-gun were a rifle, and their infantry hasn't
needed a barrage to prepare the way. There's so many of 'em."</p>

<p>I trotted on, and at the top of the street leading out of the village
recognised a mounted orderly of the battery I had belonged to before
coming to Brigade Headquarters. He was riding hard, but pulled up when
he saw me and handed me a note, saying, "Major Bartlett sent me with
this to Brigade Headquarters, sir."</p>

<p>I recognised the brigade-major's handwriting on an ordinary Army
message form. It was a note stating that we were to remain in support
of the French after our own divisional infantry had fallen back, but
that the French Divisional General hoped to relieve our artillery by 9
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> We were to fire on certain points until that hour, and
then withdraw to a village still farther south-west, and again
co-operate with our own infantry.</p>

<p>"Do you know if Major Bartlett read this?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; I saw him read it."</p>

<p>"Is the battery in action?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; they were firing when I came away."</p>

<p>Good! I knew then that Major Bartlett, on his own initiative, was
acting on the instructions contained in the brigade-major's note, and
that the other batteries would not be delayed in getting into action
if I sent the note direct to the colonel.</p>

<p>I took the orderly another quarter of a mile along the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>road, so that
he could point out the nearest way to Major Bartlett's battery; and
then told my groom to take him direct to the colonel, after which the
pair of them would rejoin me.</p>

<p>I found the major in good fettle, and, as I had guessed, blazing off
at the targets given by the B.M. As also he had passed on the orders
to B Battery, who were three hundred yards away, we at any rate had
two batteries in action. He explained to me that the Division
despatch-rider had somehow failed to find Brigade Headquarters, but
had come across him. He had got his battery into position at about two
o'clock, and they had dossed down beside the guns.</p>

<p>The major didn't know the whereabouts of D and A Batteries, so I got
on my horse again and searched a village that was farther south, but
on the same map-contour. Judge of my relief when I encountered
Fentiman, who told me that D and A would be along in ten minutes. I
emphasised the need for despatch, and he told me that the previous
night his battery's waggon lines had been taken back farther than they
should have been; the horses being thoroughly done, they had had a
proper halt at midnight. "We'll be firing in twenty minutes," he added
optimistically. "I'll dash along and work out the targets with Major
Bartlett."</p>

<p>A couple of Horse Artillery batteries had come into action a quarter
of a mile behind ours, and shells began to fly in the direction of the
enemy in business-like fashion. From the ridge we looked into a
village that sloped up again to a thick belt of trees three thousand
yards in front of us and to blue distances away on the right. Down the
slopes tiny blue figures could be seen <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>feverishly throwing up earth;
parties of twenty and thirty men, khaki-clad, every now and then
emerged from the wood, and in single file dipped down to the valley
and came towards the village I had just left. The problem would
undoubtedly be how far the retirement would proceed before French
reinforcements made the line massive enough for a proper stand. The
colonel was now with the batteries, checking their lines of fire, and
encouraging battery commanders to do their damnedest until the French
artillery came along. My groom told me that the colonel had had a very
narrow escape as he passed through Commenchon. A shell dropped thirty
yards from him, and a splinter had wounded his mare.</p>

<p>8.30 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: The eternal machine-guns were spluttering
devilishly in the wood opposite. Our infantry were coming back in
larger numbers now, and I thought glumly of what the brigade-major had
said the previous evening, "We are going to fight for this line." The
colonel had conferred with the colonel of the Horse Artillery, who
said that his orders were to pull out at 9.15, come what may. "The
Corps are particularly anxious that no more guns should be lost." The
veterinary sergeant of a Horse Artillery battery had dressed the
colonel's mare, although she was too excited for him to get the
splinter out. "I think she deserves to have a wound stripe up," smiled
the colonel, who was exceedingly fond of her.</p>

<p>9 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: No signs yet of the French artillery. There seemed to
be a curious lull in the fighting. Only the Boche long-range guns were
firing, and their shells were going well over our heads. And no more
French infantry were coming up.</p>

<p>9.20 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: The two Horse Artillery batteries were <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>away. Our
teams and limbers had come up, all except one team of C Battery. We
waited for the colonel to give the word.</p>

<p>Suddenly the "chug-chug-chug" of a motor-cycle: a despatch-rider from
Division! The colonel tore open the envelope. "A Battery ... Limber-up
and retire," he ordered; "B and D will follow."</p>

<p>"The French artillery has been stopped," he explained shortly. "We are
going to make the stand at B&eacute;thancourt, three miles farther back."</p>

<p>An officer of C Battery ran across to say that through the binoculars
grey forms could be seen in the belt of trees opposite.</p>

<p>The colonel's eyes gleamed. "Got any ammunition left after filling up
the limbers?" he asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;about fifty rounds."</p>

<p>"Right; give it 'em, and then pull out at once."</p>

<p>The officer saluted and hurried off. The colonel lighted a cigarette
and stood under a tree. "One of the most difficult things to decide
upon in war," he soliloquised, "is to know the exact moment at which
to retire."</p>

<p>The sharp crack of C's 18-pdrs. firing fifty rounds as fast as the
guns could be loaded. Then silence. Still no sign of the missing team
of horses. A corporal went by at the gallop to find out what had
happened.</p>

<p>The colonel was now on the ridge searching the trees opposite with his
glasses. Three guns had been limbered up. Every other battery had
gone. The battery commander looked puzzled and annoyed. "The guns that
are ready can move off," said the colonel calmly. "An officer is to
wait here until the team arrives to take away the other gun."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>Even as the three guns took the road the missing team and limber came
out of the village.</p>

<p>"The off-leader had cast a shoe, and they had to send back for the
farrier, sir," reported the corporal.</p>

<p>"Good," observed the colonel, "but some of you fellows will have to
remember that there's a war on, and put more 'nip' into your work."</p>

<br />

<p>11 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: It needed cool counsels and a high and steadfast
faith during the next twenty-four hours. The sunken track along which
our own and other British Artillery brigades were retreating was full
of ruts and choked with dust, and we thanked our stars that the
weather had held. That road churned into the mud-slime to which a few
hours' rain could change it, would have become impassable for wheeled
traffic. But the chief trouble was that the French "75's" coming up to
relieve us had had to turn and go back the same way as ourselves. For
the best part of a mile both sides of the narrow roads were occupied,
and only patience, forbearance, and steady command eased the block.
The Boche could not be far behind, and there was just a possibility
that we might be trapped with little chance of putting up a fight. It
was a lovely day again, baking hot, and the birds were singing their
gayest; but most of us felt savagely doleful. "I hope it is a
strategic retreat," said Fentiman viciously, "but we've had no letters
and no papers for days, and we know Blink All of what's going on. A
strategic retreat is all right, but if the fellow behind follows you
close enough to keep on kicking your tail hard all the time, you may
retreat farther than you intend. When the Boche retreated last year we
never got close enough to kick his tail&mdash;damn him."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>Two welcome diversions! The road at the point we had now reached rose
to the level of the stubble-fields, and three batteries of "75's,"
with much "<i>Hue</i>-ing" of the horses, pulled off the track and made
across the fields to another roadway. At the same time the "heavies"
woke up, and the sound of the big shells grunting through the air
above our heads and on towards the enemy who pursued us was <i>tr&egrave;s
agr&eacute;able</i>.</p>

<p>When we reached the village of B&eacute;thancourt we found two brigades of
our divisional infantry already there. Trenches were being dug, and
our B Battery had pulled their six guns behind the mile-long ridge
that ran southward from the village. The colonel joined our brigadier,
who was conferring with the two Infantry brigadiers and the G.S.O. I.,
and as a result of this war council, D Battery was ordered to continue
the march and take up a reserve position on the next ridge, two miles
farther back, south of the village of Caillouel. A and C, the
composite battery, would come into action alongside B.</p>

<p>Telephone lines were run out from the two batteries to look-out posts
on the top of the ridge 700 yards away, and the colonel ordered firing
at the rate of one round a minute. Half a dozen "75" batteries were
being loosed off with what always looks like gay abandon on the part
of the French gunners. Young Bushman was whisked off to inform the
staff captain, now at Caillouel, of the batteries' new positions, so
that ammunition supply should be kept up. We then awaited
developments.</p>

<p>The view westwards from the B&eacute;thancourt ridge that day provided one of
the most picturesque panoramas of the retreat. The centre of
B&eacute;thancourt, ridded the night before of its civilian inhabitants, was
chock-a-block with troops and military traffic; and the straight road
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>that led down into the valley, across the stream, and up again to
Caillouel, was a two-mile ribbon of blue and khaki, and waggons and
lorries, and camp kitchens&mdash;sometimes moving, oh, so slowly! once at a
standstill for over an hour. A long way to the right high rocks and
thick masses of dark trees rose, aloof; below them, thousands of
horses and hundreds of supply and ammunition waggons, some halted in
lines, some making slowly across the valley towards Caillouel.
Directly in front of us more horses, more waggons. A road at the foot
of the valley wound away to the left and then round behind the
Caillouel ridge. The valley would have served admirably for a
field-day in home training.</p>

<p>The colonel called Major Bullivant and pointed out that the stream at
the bottom was crossed by only one bridge, that over which the main
road ran. "If you are relying on that bridge for a withdrawal you will
certainly be cut off. You'd better cut down some trees and make a
bridge directly behind your battery. Of course, there's the road round
by the left, but it will be best to have another way."</p>

<p>1 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: A cavalry officer, hot and dusty, came up and said he
had hurried back because some of our artillery fire was dropping
dangerously near the French infantry. The colonel and he made a joint
inspection of maps, and the cavalry officer pointed out certain spots
which we still held.</p>

<p>"That's all right," replied the colonel. "My batteries are not firing
on that part, but I will pass word round." And he sent me to some
neighbouring batteries to explain and to warn.</p>

<p>An infantry runner came to ask the colonel if he would go across to
see the Infantry brigadier. "More moving," said the colonel when he
returned. "We are <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>to fall back on Caillouel now. Will you get back
and see that telephone wire is brought up? You know where D Battery
have gone; the other batteries will come into line with them. You can
keep H.Q. waggon line just behind Caillouel."</p>

<p>I rode off, accompanied by Beadle of A Battery, still dressed in
overcoat and pyjamas. The stream of retreating traffic on the road
between B&eacute;thancourt and Caillouel was thicker than ever; the centre of
Caillouel was as packed as a Fen village during a hiring fair; the
divisional horse-master, the C.R.E., and the D.A.Q.M.G. were among the
officers trying to sort out the muddle; and in front of the Mairie,
like a policeman on point duty, stood a perspiring staff captain.
"That'll mean the Military Cross at least," grinned Beadle. "Life's
very hard sometimes, isn't it?"</p>

<p>3 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: The batteries were now in position on Caillouel
ridge, and one brigade of the Divisional Infantry had arrived and
commenced to dig. "I must have turned up half France since we started
this retreat," growled one swarthy private, resting on his pick. "And
I was a navvy before the war, and joined up for a change."</p>

<p>I stood by the composite battery and saw four of the waggons come up
with ammunition. They had had to climb a long punishing slope over
meadow-lands and orchards, and the last five hundred yards was across
ploughed fields. The horses were blowing hard. "They've kept their
condition well, considering the work they have had to do this last
four days," remarked Dumble. "I hope the Supply Column won't fail us,
though. The horses want as much corn as they can get now."</p>

<p>"Well, the A.S.C. have had plenty of practice getting up supplies this
last three years. They ought to be able to keep touch with us, however
irregular our <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>movements&mdash;and M'Klown is a pretty smart fellow," I
answered.</p>

<p>"Rather amusing just now to recall that 'Truth' a short while ago was
saying there were too many horses in the Field Artillery, isn't it?"
went on Dumble. "They said one team a battery to pull the guns into
position from off the road would be enough, and that motor-traction
could do the rest. Never mind; the old horse has earned his keep these
last few days, hasn't he?"</p>

<p>"Look here," he added, "come along with me and I'll show you a find.
You're thirsty, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"I shall say a grand Amen if you offer me a drink," said I, taking a
deep breath.</p>

<p>"Well, come along&mdash;there's a cellar full of cider in this house here.
I've left a man in charge to see there's no hanky-panky. I'm giving my
men some, but under surveillance. No one allowed more than a pint."</p>

<p>It was the coolest, best-tasting cider I have ever drunk, not too
sweet, not too tart. A gunner tipped up the barrel and poured it into
a dilapidated-looking enamelled mug. How good it was! I quaffed half a
pint at a gulp, and said "Rather!" when asked if I would have more.</p>

<p>"Glad you liked it," said Dumble. "I must confess that that was my
third."</p>

<p>The General, suave, keen-eyed, and pleasant-spoken, came up with the
colonel and the brigade-major as we got back to the battery. The
General spoke encouragingly to most of us, and told the subalterns
that gunnery rules were as important in this sort of warfare as on the
drill-ground. "But don't forget that a cool head and common-sense are
as good assets as any," he added.</p>

<p>We were looking now from the Caillouel ridge towards <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>the B&eacute;thancourt
ridge, which we had occupied in the forenoon,&mdash;another fine landscape
with a vast plain to the right which was being keenly watched for
enemy movement. My signalling-sergeant had run out a telephone line
about 600 yards in front of the composite battery, and the General,
the colonel, and the brigade-major went along to the O.P. to see Major
Bartlett register his guns on certain points where the General thought
it likely the enemy would collect.</p>

<p>The report that our Brigade was to be relieved and our guns taken over
by our companion brigade, who had lost practically all their guns on
the 21st, became more than a report when Colonel &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; and his battery
commanders assembled to meet the General. One of the battery
commanders, a new-comer to the Brigade, was a well-known golfer whom I
had last seen fighting a most exciting match in the 1914 amateur
championship at Sandwich. He laughed when he recognised me. "A bit of
leave and a bit of golf would be a nice change now, eh? I'm afraid we
shan't know what leave is for a long time, though. But do you know
what I did the last time I was on leave and had a few rounds over my
home course&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>But the return of the General prevented my knowing the golf exploit he
was going to tell me. The colonel called me for further instructions.</p>

<p>"The &nbsp;&mdash;rd Brigade are taking over our guns to-morrow morning at 6.30,"
he said. "I shall stay here until then with General &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; (the Infantry
brigadier). I'll keep young Bushman with me, and my groom with our
horses. You had better remain at the waggon line and keep in touch
with the battery waggon lines. Will you send up my British warm when
you get back, some sandwiches for Bushman and myself, and my Thermos
flask?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>The almost paralysing block of traffic between B&eacute;thancourt and
Caillouel had thinned out now. It was easy enough also to move along
the road from Caillouel to Grandru, whither three hours ago I had
despatched H.Q. waggons to get them out of the way. For two hours,
also, there had been a marked cessation of hostile fire. And as I rode
towards Grandru I thought of those reports of big British successes at
Ypres and at Cambrai. They seemed feasible enough. What if they were
true, and what if the offensive on this front had been checked because
of the happenings North? It was a pleasant thought, and I rather
hugged it.</p>

<p>Later there was grim proof that the lull merely meant that the Hun was
bringing up his guns and putting in fresh divisions to buffet and
press our tired worn men.</p>

<p>5 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: When I reached Grandru and sat down in a hay-field
while my servant brought me a cup of tea and some bread and cheese, I
gave my mind to a five minutes' reconstruction of the incidents and
aspects of the last four days. It had all been so hurried, and each
particular emergency had demanded such complete concentration, that it
was more than difficult to realise that so short a time had elapsed
since the German hordes began their rush. I longed to see a newspaper,
to read a lucid and measured account of the mighty conflict in which
our brigade, the centre of my present workaday world, could only have
played such a tiny part. I longed for a chance to let my friends in
England know that all was well with me. However&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The regimental sergeant-major had established the H.Q. horse lines in
a roadside field just outside the village. I wouldn't let him unload
the waggons, but the brigade clerk, devout adherent of orderliness and
routine, had already opened the brigade office in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>first cottage
on the right of the village street, while the cook was in possession
next door. It was the first village we had come to during the retreat,
whence all the civilian inhabitants had not fled, and the cook talked
of fresh eggs for breakfast. I shaved and had a scrub down, put on a
clean collar, and gained a healthier outlook on life generally. I sent
out the four cycle orderlies to scout around and find the battery
waggon lines, which I knew were coming to this vicinity, and the
A.S.C. supply officer rode up and discussed the best place for
unloading the morrow's food and forage for the brigade. That settled,
I wrote out the formal information for the batteries, and then decided
to stroll round the village before dinner. "I've got a rabbit for your
dinner to-night, sir," called the cook from his kitchen door, "a fresh
rabbit." So I promised to be back by 8 o'clock.</p>

<p>When I came back there was an awkward surprise. All our waggons had
been shifted and a French heavy battery were hauling their howitzers
up the incline that led from the road to the field. The senior French
officer was polite but firm. He was sorry to disturb us, but this was
the most suitable spot for his howitzers to fire from.</p>

<p>The sergeant-major asked me whether I would like to shift the horses
to such-and-such a spot in the field, but I said "No" to that. "These
guns will be firing all night, and the horses will be only thirty
yards away from them. They'll have no rest whatever, and they want
every minute they can get. No, the Brigade are coming out of action
to-morrow morning. We'll shift our waggon line right away to the other
side of the village. Saddle-up at once, and get away before it is
dark. Move well away from the village while you are about it, and camp
by the roadside."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>The cook looked glum and said my rabbit was cooked to a turn. "Keep it
for me until we get settled down again," I said. I posted a cycle
orderly to wait at the spot we were leaving, so as to re-direct
messengers arriving from Division or from the colonel; the brigade
clerk asked to be allowed to stay behind until the three other
orderlies returned from the batteries&mdash;he wouldn't feel justified in
leaving before then, he assured me. It was 8.15 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> when our
little procession headed by the sergeant-major passed through the
village.</p>

<p>I had sent my horses on, and it was on the point of darkness when I
strode through the village, some way behind the column. A few officers
of the Pioneer battalion that was moving out any moment stood at open
doorways, and a group of drivers waited near the bridge ready to
harness up their mules. Three aged women dressed in faded black, one
of them carrying a bird-cage, had come out of a cottage and walked
with feeble ungainly step towards the bridge. A couple of ancient men,
pushing wheel-barrows piled high with household goods, followed.</p>

<p>Out of the distance came the brooding whine of an approaching howitzer
shell. A mighty rush of air, a blinding flash, and an appalling crash.
An 8-inch had fallen in the middle of the street.</p>

<p>A running to and fro; a heartrending, whimpering cry from one of the
women; and groans and curses farther up the street. None of the poor
terror-stricken old people were hurt, thank God! but three of the
drivers had been hit and two mules killed outright. The men were
quickly lifted into the shelter of the nearest house, and the civilian
refugees took cover in a doorway just before the second shell tore a
great rent in the village green on the other side of the bridge. Five
shells fell in all, and an officer afterwards tried <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>to persuade the
old women to take a lift in a G.S. waggon that was about to start. But
they refused to leave their men, who would not abandon the
wheel-barrows. When I walked away the five were again beginning their
slow hazardous pilgrimage to the next village.</p>

<p>11 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: That night I lay rolled up in a blanket at the foot
of a tree. The H.Q. waggon line was duly settled for the night when I
arrived&mdash;horses "hayed-up" and most of the men asleep on the ground.
The cook insisted on producing the boiled rabbit, and I ate it,
sitting on the shaft of the mess cart. I arranged with the N.C.O. of
the piquet to change every two hours the orderly posted at the spot we
had left so hurriedly&mdash;it was only ten minutes' ride on a cycle&mdash;and
kept another sentry on the watch for messengers who might come
searching for us. It was again a beautiful clear night, with a
resplendent moon; a few long-range shells whizzed over, but none near
enough to worry us; a pioneer party worked right through the night,
putting up a stout line of barbed wire that went within thirty yards
of where I lay; retreating baggage-waggons, French and British, passed
along the road; restless flashes along the eastern skyline showed our
guns in active defence.</p>

<p>I cannot say that I slept. The ground was hard, and it got very cold
about 2 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> I could hear the sergeant-major snoring
comfortably on the straw palliasse he had managed to "commandeer" for
himself. At about 3 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> my ear caught the "chug-chug" of a
motor-cycle. It came nearer and then stopped, and I heard the rider
and our sentry talking. I got up and found it was the Divisional
Artillery signalling-officer.</p>

<p>"Rather important," he said, without preamble. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>"The General says it
is essential to get all transport vehicles over the canal to-night.
There's bound to be a hell of a crush in the morning. Headquarters
R.A. will be at Varesnes by to-morrow morning, so I should move as far
that way as you can. I've just come over the canal, and there are two
ways of crossing from here. I think you'll find the Appilly route the
least crowded. The great thing is to hurry. I'm going to look for the
colonel now. I'll tell him you are moving."</p>

<p>We bade each other "Good-night." While the horses were being hooked
in, I scribbled an order explaining the situation, and instructing all
battery waggon lines to move towards Varesnes at once. I knew that in
view of the 6.30 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> relief by the &nbsp;&mdash;rd Brigade, horses
would be sent up for the officers and men at the guns, and it was
possible that the guns would now be brought back from the Caillouel
ridge before that time. The Boche was clearly coming on once more.</p>

<p>Cycle orderlies sped away with the notes, and I was sending a
signaller on a cycle to tell the sentry posted at Grandru to rejoin
us, when I discovered that the brigade clerk had not yet turned up. I
told the signaller to send him along as well.</p>

<p>Two of the orderlies returned and reported that B and D Batteries had
received my instructions and had started. With the return of the next
orderly I explained where we were to go to the sergeant-major, and
told him to move off. I would come along behind with the others.</p>

<p>To my astonishment the signaller and the sentry came back without the
brigade clerk. "Can't find him anywhere, sir," said the signaller.
"Didn't you see him while you were there?" I asked the orderly who had
been doing sentry. "No, sir. I saw no lights in that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>house where the
office was, and there's no one there now."</p>

<p>This was something unexpected, not to say perturbing. I turned to one
of the cycle orderlies who stood by. "Go back and make a thorough
search for Briercliffe. Don't come back until you are satisfied he's
not in the village. I'll wait here. You others, except one cyclist, go
on and catch up the column."</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, half an hour! The orderly
returned alone. "I can't find Briercliffe, sir. I've been into every
house in Grandru. He's not there."</p>

<p>I couldn't understand it. The amazingly conscientious, thoroughly
correct, highly efficient Briercliffe to be missing. "I can't wait any
longer," I said, mounting my horse. "He's quite wide awake and should
be all right. We'll get on."</p>

<h3>X. THE SCRAMBLE AT VARESNES<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>4 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: For the best part of a mile my groom and I had the
moonlit road to ourselves. We passed at the walk through the
stone-flagged streets of Bab&oelig;uf, our horses' hoofs making
clattering echoes in what might have been a dead city. Along the whole
length of the tortuous main street were only two indications that
there was life behind the closed doors and fastened shutters. Two
French soldiers, leaning against a wall and talking, moved away as we
rode up; then a door banged, and all was quiet. Once, too, a cat ran
stealthily across and startled my horse: I remember that distinctly,
because it was the first cat I had seen since coming back to the
fighting area.</p>

<p>At the junction, where the way from Bab&oelig;uf joined the main road
that ran parallel with the canal, stood a single British lorry. A
grey-headed lieutenant, who was lighting a cigarette, came up when I
hailed him, and told me our waggons had passed. He had pointed out the
way, and they had gone to the left. "The first turning on the right
after that will bring you to the bridge," he ended.</p>

<p>Our column was now moving along one of France's wonderful main
roads&mdash;perfectly straight, tree-bordered, half its width laid with
pav&eacute;. On either side good-sized villas, well-kept front gardens,
"highly desirable <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>residences"&mdash;comfortable happy homes a week before,
now shattered, silent, deserted. The road as we followed it led direct
to the battle-front.</p>

<p>We had gone a mile past the railway station, and were in open country,
and had still to reach the first turning to the right. I asked the
sergeant-major to trot ahead and let me know how much farther we had
to go. "Over a mile yet, sir," was his report.</p>

<p>At last, however, a sign-post loomed up, and we struck right along a
track that led over dreary waste lands. Before long we were forging
through a damp clinging mist, that obviously came from the canal.
Somewhere near the point towards which we were making, shells from a
Boche big gun were exploding with dull heavy boomings. I sent the
sergeant-major forward again, and he came back with the bewildering
report, "We're on the wrong road, sir!"</p>

<p>"Wrong road!" I repeated. "What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"There are some French lorries in front, sir, and the sentry won't
open the bridge gates to let them cross."</p>

<p>I felt puzzled and angered, and rode forward to question the French
sentry. Half a dozen protesting lorry-drivers stood round him.</p>

<p>The bridge did lead to Varesnes, he admitted, but it was only a light
bridge, and he had orders to allow no military traffic over it. I
became almost eloquent in describing the extreme lightness of my
vehicles; but a <i>sous-officier</i> stepped out of a little hut and said
he was sorry, the orders were very strict, and he could not open the
gates. The bridge we wanted was approached by the next turning to the
right, off the main road. He assured me that it was a much better way,
and, in any case, he couldn't open the gates.</p>

<p>There was nothing else for it: we made the long <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>tedious journey back,
out of the fog and into it again, and so got on the right track.</p>

<p>Weariness through lack of sleep and the dampness of the air made one
feel chilly, and I got off my horse and walked. The horses stepped out
mechanically; the men had lost their chirpiness. There was a half-hour
or so when I felt melancholy and depressed: the feeling of
helplessness against the triumphant efficiency of the Boche got on
one's nerves. Wasn't this talk of luring him on a myth? Why was he
allowed to sweep forward at this overpowering pace, day after day,
when each of our big advances had been limited to one hard, costly
attack&mdash;and then stop? I quickened my step, and walked forward to
where A Battery moved along the same road.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Dumble," I said. "You and C are running as separate batteries
again, aren't you? How did you leave the cider-cellar?"</p>

<p>"We came back from there at about 5 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>" There was a big
discussion as to whether we should come farther back. The colonel
wanted to stay, and the &nbsp;&mdash;rd's B Battery were in action there until
four this morning. It was a Divisional decision that there should be a
retirement to the next ridge. The poor old infantry were fed to the
teeth. They'd sweated blood digging trenches all day on the Caillouel
ridge, and then in the evening had to fall back and start digging
again.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the colonel?" I asked.</p>

<p>"He was still there with General &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; when we came away. The &nbsp;&mdash;rd
relieved us last night, instead of first thing this morning; and we
got down to Grandru, and had three hours' sleep before your note
arrived."</p>

<p>"Battery's pretty done, I suppose?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>"Well, it was just about time we came out of action. Men and horses
would have been all-in in another day."</p>

<p>We crossed the fine broad canal, watched by the French soldiers
guarding the bridge. Dumble was silent for some seconds, and then
muttered, "You know, I hate to be coming back like this with the
French looking on."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," I replied,&mdash;"but they are good soldiers, and they
understand."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;when I think of poor old Harville, and the fight he put up&mdash;&mdash;"
he broke off; and we trudged along.</p>

<p>"Do you know Harville always kept that speech of Beatty's in his
pocket-book, that speech where he said England would have to be
chastened and turn to a new way of life before we finished the war?"
said Dumble later.</p>

<p>"Yes, he was like that&mdash;old Harville," I said quietly.</p>

<p>Over another bridge; and I still walked with Dumble at the head of his
battery. There was a long wait while a line of French waggons moved
out of our way. Some of the men were yawning with the sleepiness that
comes from being cold as well as tired. We were now on the outskirts
of a village that lay four miles from Varesnes.</p>

<p>"What do you say if we stop at this place and go on after a rest?"
said Dumble. I agreed.</p>

<p>I put Headquarter waggons and horses into an orchard, and found a
straw-loft where the men could lie down.</p>

<p>It was six in the morning, and I told the sergeant-major to have
breakfast up at 7.30. There was a cottage opposite the orchard; some
French soldiers were inside breakfasting. As I looked through the
window I felt I would give anything for a sleep. The old housewife, a
woman with a rosy Punch-like face, waited on the men. I asked her if
she would let me <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>have a room. She demurred a while, said everything
was dirty and in disorder: the French <i>sous-officier</i> was not gone
yet. Then I think she noticed how fagged I was. In two minutes my
servant had brought my valise in. "I'm going to take my clothes off,"
I said, "but don't let me sleep after 7.30."</p>

<p>7.30 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: I woke to find the sun streaming through the
window. The booming of guns sounded nearer than before. I got off the
bed and looked out. The fifty Headquarter men were breakfasting or
smoking. Something prompted me: I had the feeling that we ought to
leave the village at once. I shouted through the window for the
sergeant-major. The column could be ready to move in a quarter of an
hour, he answered. My servant brought me a change of boots and
leggings, and I shaved. "Won't you wait and have breakfast, sir?"
asked the sergeant-major. "No. Pack up everything; we'll get to
Varesnes as soon as you are ready."</p>

<p>I went round to see Dumble before we started, but he said he wasn't
going to hurry. "I'll let the men have a proper clean-up and march off
about eleven," he decided.</p>

<p>The Headquarter column wound away from the village, and set out on a
long smooth road that ran through a wood and edged away from the
canal. Two miles from Varesnes we met the brigade-major. His tired
eyes lighted up when he saw me. "What batteries have actually got over
the canal?" he questioned. I told him that A were in the village I had
just left. "C and B are coming round by the Noyon bridge," he informed
me. "I expect we shall send Headquarters and B on to Thiescourt to get
you out of the way&mdash;and give you some rest." And he nodded and rode
on.</p>

<p>It looked as if the German rush was not expected to go much farther,
for Varesnes was the first little town <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>fully occupied by civilians
that we had come to. Most of them were preparing to leave, and roomy
French farm carts, piled high with curious medleys of mattresses,
chairs and tables, clothing, carpets, kitchen utensils, clocks and
pictures, kept moving off. But children played about the streets;
girls stood and talked to French and British soldiers; and M. le Maire
continued to function.</p>

<p>The colonel, neat and unruffled, but pale with fatigue, stood waiting
in the main thoroughfare as we came in. I informed him at once where I
had left A Battery and what the brigade-major had mentioned. He told
me he had remained with the Infantry brigadier until 6.30
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>, the hour at which Colonel &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; of the &nbsp;&mdash;rd had formally
to relieve him; and he had only just crossed the canal. The infantry
were still falling back. "I've lost Laneridge and my two horses," he
added, shaking his head. "Laneridge missed me in the fog when I sent
for him, and I'm half afraid he went towards the Hun lines. It was
very puzzling to get your bearings up there this morning. I walked
part of the way here and got a lift in a lorry."</p>

<p>9.30 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: The colonel had seen the C.R.A. and received
instructions about continuing the march. We were going on another ten
miles to the place which a week ago was to have become the rest area
for Divisional Headquarters. I had come across a section of the D.A.C.
who had arrived the night before and secured a billet, and they gave
the colonel and myself breakfast. I had discovered B Battery's mess in
another cottage, every officer deep in a regular Rip Van Winkle
slumber that told of long arrears of sleep. And I had been greatly
cheered by the sudden appearance, mounted on a horse, of Briercliffe,
the missing brigade clerk. He explained his absence. When one of the
orderlies returned to Grandru, saying he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>couldn't find B Battery's
waggon lines, the admirable Briercliffe had retorted that they must be
found, and he went in quest of them himself. Then when he heard the
sudden order to cross the canal he had the common-sense to come along
with B Battery.</p>

<p>Neither C Battery nor A Battery had yet arrived. The colonel, having
shaved, felt ready for the fray again, dictated the route-march
orders, and told me to fix 11.30 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> as the time of
starting. Fortunately his horses and his groom had turned up. The
traffic down the main street, with its old-fashioned plaster houses,
its squat green doors, and the Mairie with its railed double-stone
steps, was getting more congested. Infantry transport and French heavy
guns were quickening their pace as they came through. The inhabitants
were moving out in earnest now, not hurriedly, but losing no time. A
group of hatless women stood haranguing on the Mairie steps; a
good-looking girl, wearing high heels and bangles, unloaded a
barrow-load of household goods into a van the Maire had provided, and
hastened home with the barrow to fill it again; a sweet-faced old
dame, sightless, bent with rheumatism, pathetic in her helpless
resignation, sat on a wicker-chair outside her doorway, waiting for a
farm cart to take her away: by her side, a wide-eyed solemn-faced
little girl, dressed in her Sunday best, and trying bravely not to
cry.</p>

<p>10.15 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: The colonel met me in the street; he had just
come from seeing the C.R.A. again. "Better tell B and D Batteries to
move off at once, B leading. Headquarters can start as well. It will
be best to get out of this place as quickly as possible. The enemy is
coming on fast, and there will be an awkward crush shortly."</p>

<p>11 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: The Boche machine-guns could be heard now as plainly
as if they were fighting along the canal banks. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>B Battery had marched
out with their waggons, Headquarters behind them. I stood with the
colonel in the square to watch the whole brigade go through. Young
Bushman had ridden off towards the canal to seek news of C Battery.</p>

<p>And now the first enemy shell: a swishing rush of air and a vicious
crack&mdash;a 4&middot;2 H.V. It fell two streets from us. Another and another
followed. Shouts from behind! The drivers spurred their horses to a
trot. Clouds of dust rose. Odd civilians alternately cowered against
the wall and ran panting for the open country, making frightened cries
as each shell came over. A butcher's cart and a loaded market cart got
swept into the hurrying military traffic.</p>

<p>"I don't like this," muttered the colonel, frowning. "It would be
stupid to have a panic."</p>

<p>On the Mairie steps I could see M. le Maire ringing a hand-bell and
shouting some sort of proclamation. With a certain dignity, and
certainly with little apparent recognition that shells were falling
close, he descended the steps and strode along the street and through
the square, all the time determinedly shaking his bell. As he passed,
I asked him gravely why he rang the bell. He stared over his glasses
with astonishment, responded simply "Pour partir, m'sieur," and walked
on, still ringing. A bizarre incident, but an instance of duty, highly
conceived and carried out to the end.</p>

<p>A colonel of one of our Pioneer battalions rode by and hailed the
colonel. "We seem to be driving it pretty close," he said. "There's a
lot more artillery to cross yet, and they are shelling the bridge
hard. Which way do you go from here?"</p>

<p>"I've got two batteries to come, and I'm afraid one <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>of 'em's still
over the bridge," responded the colonel. "We go to Thiescourt from
here."</p>

<p>11.30 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>: D Battery was passing now, with A not far behind.
The stream of traffic making for beyond the town was continuous as
ever, but the shelling had quietened, and the horses were kept at the
walk. The colonel stood and accepted the salutes of his batteries, and
criticised points of turn-out and horse-mastership as though he were
making an ordinary route-march inspection. And this compelling them to
think of something other than the physical dangers around and behind
them, had its moral effect upon the men. They held themselves more
erect, showed something of pride of regiment and race, and looked men
fit and worthy to fight again.</p>

<p>Civilians were still hurrying out of the town. A family passed us, the
husband in his best suit of dull black, top-hat, and white tie and
all, pushing a perambulator loaded with clothes, household ornaments,
and cooking requisites, his three children dragging at their mother's
skirts and weeping piteously. A fine-looking <i>vieillard</i>, with
clean-cut waxen features and white flowing moustaches, who wore his
brown velvet jacket and sombrero with an air, walked by erect and
slow, taking what he could of his belongings on a wheel-barrow. Even
the conjunction of the wheel-barrow could not prevent him looking
dignified and resolute.</p>

<p>And a terrier and a young retriever, oblivious of the tragedy around
them, gambolled up and down the Mairie steps and chased each other
across the street.</p>

<p>12 noon: Bigger shells had begun to fall, and still C Battery had not
come. The colonel glanced at his watch. One shell came near enough to
send a chimney-pot and some slates clattering to the ground, making a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>pair of water-cart horses plunge wildly; a French soldier was killed
farther down the street. An officer cantered by and directed a Horse
Artillery battery that had passed a few minutes before, and had a
clear half-mile of road in front of it, to break into a trot. Voices
in rear could be heard shouting to those in front to go faster. Two
riderless, runaway wheelers, dragging a smashed limber-pole, raced
after the Horse Artillery battery. "I'm afraid we shall have to say
Good-bye to C Battery," said the colonel seriously.</p>

<p>I walked to the end of the square and looked down the road towards the
canal. Dust rose in clouds, and straining horses still came on. Out of
the welter I saw young Bushman's horse on the pathway coming towards
me. "C Battery's all right," he shouted to me, and a minute later I
heard him explaining to the colonel.</p>

<p>"C Battery's over now, sir. It has been touch-and-go. Some Horse
Artillery in front had a waggon hit, and that caused a stoppage; and
there were a lot of other waggons in front as well. They are putting
shells all round the bridge now, sir. C Battery have had two gunners
wounded, but they are over now, sir."</p>

<p>C Battery came through at a trot, but the colonel regarded their
general appearance as soldierly. We remained in the square and saw the
tail-end of their mess cart.</p>

<p>"And now," observed the colonel, lighting a cigarette and noting the
time, "we may as well gather our horses and get along ourselves."</p>

<p>"I feel very relieved about C Battery," he said five minutes later as
we rode along; and he smiled for the first time for quite three
hours.</p>

<h3>XI. THE G IN GAP<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>1 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: For some miles after leaving Varesnes it was
retreat&mdash;rapid, undisguised, and yet with a plan. Thousands of men,
scores of guns and transport vehicles, hundreds of civilians caught in
the last rush, all struggling to evade the mighty pincers' clutch of
the German masses who, day after day, were crushing our attempts to
rally against their weight and fury. Unless collectedly, in order, and
with intercommunications unbroken, we could pass behind the strong
divisions hurrying to preserve the precious contact between French and
British, we should be trapped. And when I say we, I mean the very
large force of which our Brigade formed one tiny part. Not even the
colonel knew much at this moment of the wider strategy that was being
worked out. The plain and immediate task was to free the Brigade, with
its seven hundred odd men and its horses and waggons, from the welter
of general traffic pouring on to the main roads, and bring it intact
to the village that Division had fixed as our destination. And as we
had now become a non-fighting body, a brigade of Field Artillery
without guns, it was more than ever our business to get out of the
way.</p>

<p>Our men found room for some of the aged civilians in motor-lorries and
G.S. waggons; but I shall always remember one silver-haired dame who
refused to be separated from the wheel-barrow heaped up with her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>belongings, which she was pushing to a place seven miles away. For
some reason she would not allow a gunner to wheel the barrow for her.
Poor obstinate old soul! I hope she got away; if she didn't, I trust
the Boche was merciful.</p>

<p>The colonel and I rode through a forest in order to catch up the
batteries. As we emerged from the wood we came upon five brigades of
cavalry&mdash;three French and two British&mdash;fresh as paint, magnificently
mounted, ready and waiting. "The most cheering sight we've seen this
morning," remarked the colonel.</p>

<p>We came up with C Battery, and rode at their head. Despite the spurt
to cross the canal, their turn-out was smart and soldierly, and there
was satisfaction in the colonel's quick, comprehensive glance. Through
Pontoise, another village from which the inhabitants had fled the day
before, and past the outskirts of Noyon, with its grey cathedral and
quaint tower. The evacuation here had been frantic, and we heard
stories of pillage and looting and of drunken men&mdash;not, one is glad to
say it, British soldiers. In all that galling, muddling week I did not
see a single drunken soldier. As we were near a considerable town, I
gave my groom twenty francs, and told him to buy what food he could:
we might be very short by nightfall. He returned with some sardines,
some tinned tunny fish, and a few biscuits, the sardines costing five
francs a small tin. At one cross-road a dozen American Red Cross cars
were drawn up, and I recall the alacrity of a middle-aged American
doctor, wearing gold pince-nez, in hopping off his ambulance and
snapshotting the colonel at the head of the battery. I wondered
bitterly whether that photograph would subsequently be published under
the heading, "British Artillery in Retreat."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>2.30 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: The four batteries were now ranged alongside a
railway siding at a point where the road by which we had journeyed
joined the main road to Compi&egrave;gne. For several hours this great
traffic artery had been packed with troops and transport moving to and
from the battle-front. It was hot and dusty, and our men and horses
were glad of the half-hour's halt, although the respite had only
lasted so long because the traffic on the main route had been too
continuous for us to turn on to it and reach the road fifty yards
farther down along which we had to continue. Remembering a lesson of
the Mons retreat emphasised by a Horse Artillery major lecturing at
Larkhill&mdash;that his horses kept their condition because every time
there was a forced halt near a village he despatched his gunners with
the water-buckets&mdash;I had told my groom to search around until he found
water for my two horses. Then I stood under the trees lining the main
road and watched three battalions of French infantry march past,
moving north of the part of the front our brigade had just left. They
were older, smaller, more town-bred French soldiers than those we had
seen during the two previous days, more spectacles among them, and a
more abstracted expression. The thought came to me that here must be
last-line reserves. Up on the steep hills that overlooked the railway
siding bearded French troops were deepening trenches and strengthening
barbed wire.</p>

<p>3 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: We were anxious to get on now, and longed for a
couple of City of London traffic policemen to stand in majestic and
impartial control of these road junctions. The colonel and Major
Bullivant, after expostulating five minutes with a French major, had
got our leading battery across. Then the long line of traffic on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>main route resumed its apparently endless flow. An R.A.M.C. captain
came out and stood by as I stationed myself opposite the road we
wanted our three remaining batteries to turn down, watching to take
quick advantage of the G in the first possible <span class="sc">Gap</span>. "Pretty
lively here last night," volunteered the R.A.M.C. captain. "General
scramble to get out, and some unusual sights. There was a big ordnance
store, and they hadn't enough lorries to get the stuff away, so they
handed out all manner of goods to prevent them being wasted. The men
got pretty well <i>carte blanche</i> in blankets, boots, and puttees, and
you should have seen them carting off officers' shirts and
underclothing. There was a lot of champagne going begging too, and
hundreds of bottles were smashed to make sure the men had no chance of
getting blind. And there was an old sapper colonel who made it his
business to get hold of the stragglers. He kept at it about six hours,
and bunged scores of wanderers into a prisoners-of-war cage; then he
had 'em marched off to a collecting station. He was hot stuff, I can
tell you."</p>

<p>A gap came at last on the main route, but something also that would
dam the opening we had awaited for over an hour.</p>

<p>A tremendous line of French lorries was moving towards me on the road
opposite. The French officer in charge had come forward to reconnoitre
the crossing. Three British lorries, loading up, also stood on the
road along which we wanted to go. If the French lorries reached that
spot first, our batteries might be held up another hour. It was a
moment for unscrupulous action. I told my groom to dash off and tell
Major Bartlett to come along at the trot; then I slipped across and
engaged the French captain in conversation. If I could <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>prevent him
signalling back for his lorries to quicken speed, all would be well.
If Major Bartlett failed, there would be a most unholy mix up near the
three stationary lorries. Major Bartlett responded nobly. His leading
team reached the three lorries while the first French motor-waggon was
still thirty yards away. The gap between the stationary lorry and the
moving one narrowed to eight yards; but the waggon and six horses were
through, and the battery now commanded the position with a line of
horsed waggons and baggage-carts stretching back along the fifty yards
of the main road, with A and B Batteries following in column of route
past the railway siding. The line of French lorries extended back far
as the eye could see. The French officer turned sharply, cursed
impatiently, and asserted volubly that his lorries must come through.
I explained soothingly what a long time we had waited, and asked his
forbearance. Meanwhile C Battery continued to trot through the gap,
and I called Heaven to witness that the whole of our Brigade would be
through and away before ten minutes passed. I ran back to urge A and B
Batteries to keep up the pace. When our very last water-cart,
mess-cart, and G.S. waggon had passed, I thanked the French officer
with great sincerity, and felt I had done a proper job of work.</p>

<p>4.30 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: We sat by the roadside eating
bread-and-cheese&mdash;the colonel, young Bushman, and I. The batteries
were well on the way to their destination; and we three, jogging along
in rear, had encountered Bombardier M'Donald, triumphant at having
filled his forage and rations waggon for yet another day. So we and
our grooms helped ourselves to bread-and-cheese and satisfied hefty
appetites, and drank the cider with which Bushman had filled his flask
at Caillouel the day before.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>Another of the mournful side-spectacles of the retreat was being
enacted under our eyes. Opposite a small cottage a cart packed to a
great height, but marvellously balanced on its two huge wheels, stood
ready to move off. A wrinkled sad-eyed woman, perched on top, held
beside her her grandchild&mdash;a silent, wondering little girl. A darkly
handsome, strongly-built daughter had tied a cow to the back of the
cart. A bent old man began to lead the wide-backed Percheron mare that
was yoked to the shafts with the mixture of straps and bits of rope
that French farm folk find does well enough for harness. But the cow,
bellowing in an abandonment of grief, tugged backwards, and the cart
did not move. The daughter, proud-eyed, self-reliant, explained that
the cow was calling for her calf. The calf would never be able to make
the journey, and they had been compelled to sell it, and it would be
killed for food. It was hard, but it was war.</p>

<p>They tried again; but the cow refused to be comforted, and tugged
until the rope threatened to strangle her. They brought the calf out
again and tied him alongside his now pacified mother; but this time,
when the cart moved forward, he protested in fear and bewilderment,
and tried to drag himself free. The cart was still there when we rode
off.</p>

<p>Our way ran through a noble stretch of hilly country, well wooded,
with sparkling streams plashing down the hillsides&mdash;a landscape of
uninhabited quiet. Two aeroplanes droned overhead&mdash;the first Allied
planes we had seen since the retreat began. "The old French line,"
observed the colonel, pointing out a wide system of well-planned
trenches, deep dug-outs, and broad belts of rusted barbed wire. "The
Boche ought not to get through here."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>Up and over a hill, and down into a tiny hamlet which more stricken
civilians were preparing to leave. As our little cavalcade drew near,
a shrinking old woman, standing in a doorway, drew a frightened little
girl towards her, and held a hand over the child's eyes. "I believe
they took us to be Germans at first," said the colonel when we had
passed.</p>

<p>In another village a woman was trying to make a cow pull a
heavily-laden waggon up the hill. With streaming eyes and piteous
gestures she besought us to assist with our horses. She would pay us
money. Twice before she had lost everything through the Boche, she
pleaded. The colonel looked grieved, but shook his head. "We'll send
back a pair of draught-horses if we can," was all he said to me. And
we did.</p>

<p>6 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: We had reached Thiescourt, a hillside village that
had thought never to be threatened by the Germans again. Dwellings
damaged during their last visit had been repaired. New houses made of
fine white stone, quarried in the district, had been built, and were
building. The bitterness of it, if the foul devastating Boche were to
come again! There were many evidences of the hurried flight of the
last two days,&mdash;torn letters and papers, unswept fire-grates,
unconsumed food and drinks, beds with sheets in them, drawers
hurriedly searched for articles that could be taken away, disconsolate
wandering dogs. A few days before it had been arranged that the
major-general, his Divisional Staff, Ordnance, the Divisional brass
band, and all the usual appurtenances of a Divisional Headquarters,
should come and make this village a Divisional rest area. Few even of
the first preparations for visitation were left now. D.A.D.O.S.,
blue-tabbed and business-like, was in the main street, bewailing the
scarcity of lorries for removing his wares <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>to an area still farther
back. He had several rifles he would be pleased to hand out to our
batteries. There was a large quantity of clothing which would have to
be left in the store he had established. Any we didn't want would we
burn, or drop in the stream before we left? No lorry to remove the
Divisional canteen. Would we distribute the supplies free to our men?
Biscuits, chocolate, potted meats, tooth-paste, and cigarettes went
like wildfire.</p>

<p>Brigade H.Q. mess was installed in a new house that had chalked
messages scrawled on doors, walls, and mirrors, telling searching
relations and friends the address in a distant town to which the
occupants of the house had fled. In another dwelling that Boche
aeroplanes had already bombed, we discovered sleeping quarters. At 7
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> a lieutenant on a motor-cycle arrived with Corps orders
for the morrow. We were to leave for Elincourt immediately the
tactical situation demanded it.</p>

<p>We dined early, and sought our beds early too. I had been asleep two
minutes, as I thought&mdash;really about an hour and a half&mdash;when Dumble
woke me up. "Cavalry are coming through," he said, shining his
electric torch right in my eyes, "and they say the enemy is at Lagny.
Hadn't you better let the colonel know?"</p>

<p>"No," I retorted with some asperity.</p>

<p>"But listen; can you hear all that traffic? It's our infantry coming
back."</p>

<p>"Can you hear machine-gun fire?" I asked resentfully.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm damned if I disturb the colonel until you can tell me that,
at least," I said finally, turning on my right side.</p>

<h3>XII. OUT OF THE WAY<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>The usual monotonous spectacle when we woke next morning: the narrow
streets of what a few days before had been a tranquil, out-of-the-war
village choked with worn-out troops marching to go into rest. Now that
we had become a brigade of artillery without guns, a British
non-fighting unit struggling to get out of the way of a man&oelig;uvring
French army, our one great hope was that Corps would send us right
back to a depot where we could refit ourselves with fresh guns and
reinforcements, to some spot where we need not be wondering every five
minutes whether the enemy was at our heels. Men who have fought four
days and nights on end feel like that when the strain of actual battle
ceases.</p>

<p>The Boche guns sounded nearer, and the colonel had ordered a mounted
officer to go back and seek definite information upon the situation.
By 10 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> a retiring French battalion marched through, and
reported that the line was again being withdrawn. By 11 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>
two batteries of "75's" came back. Which decided the colonel that the
tactical situation demanded our departure, and the Brigade began the
march to Elincourt. On past more evacuated villages. Abandoned farm
carts&mdash;some of which our batteries eagerly adopted for transporting
stores and kit&mdash;and the carcases of dogs, shot or poisoned, lying by
the roadside, told their own story of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>the rush from the Hun. By 1
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> we reached Elincourt, a medieval town whose gable-ends
and belfry towers, and straight rows of hoary lime-trees, breathed the
grace and charm of the real France. I made immediately for the Mairie,
bent upon securing billets for officers and men; but standing at the
gateway was a Corps despatch-rider who handed over instructions for
the Brigade to continue the march to Estree St Denis, a town twenty
kilometres distant.</p>

<p>5 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: Estree St Denis, to which I rode in advance with a
billeting officer from each battery, proved to be a drab smoky town of
mean-looking, jerry-built houses. One thought instinctively of the
grimiest parts of Lancashire and the Five Towns. The wide and
interminably long main street was filled with dust-laden big guns and
heavy hows., four rows of them. Every retreating Division in France
seemed to be arriving and to be bringing more dust. Hundreds of
refugees from villages now in Boche possession had come, too. What a
place to be sent to! It was useless looking for billets, so I fixed
upon a vast field on the outskirts of the town where we could
establish our horse lines and pitch tents and bivouacs. This was
satisfactory enough, but the watering problem was bound to be
difficult. Four small pumps in the main street and one tiny brackish
pond totalled the facilities. It would take each battery an hour and a
half to water its horses. "Corps moves in most mysterious ways,"
crooned Stone. "Why did they send us here?" We rode and walked until
we were tired, but found nothing that would improve matters. Then
Fentiman, Stone, and I found the Caf&eacute; de la Place, and entered the
"Officers only" room, where we sat down to a bottle of wine and
devoured the Continental 'Daily Mail' of March 23, the first <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>paper we
had seen since starting the retreat. Madame informed us that some
officers of Divisional Headquarters had turned up the day before and
were dining there. As we went out to go and meet the batteries and
lead them to the waggon lines, there was a shout of recognition, and
"Swiffy" and the little American doctor ran up, grinning and rather
shamefaced. "We thought of posting you as deserters," I said with
pretended seriousness, "not having seen you since the afternoon of the
23rd." It was now the 26th. They narrated a long and somewhat sheepish
story that, boiled down, told of a barn that promised a sound
afternoon's nap, an awakening to find every one vanished; then a
worried and wearied tramp in search of us, with nothing to eat except
what they could beg or buy at ruinous prices; one perturbing two hours
when they found themselves walking into the arms of the oncoming Hun;
and finally, a confirmed resolve never to stray far from the Brigade
mess-cart again.</p>

<p>7 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>: When the batteries were settled in their waggon
lines, I led the colonel and "Swiffy" and the doctor through the
crowded dusty streets into the Caf&eacute; de la Place. The restaurant was
filled with French and British officers. "Swiffy" insisted on cracking
a bottle of champagne to celebrate the return of the doctor and
himself to the fold; then I spotted Ronny Hertford, the Divisional
salvage officer, who was full of talk and good cheer, and said he had
got his news from the new G.S.O. II., who had just come from England,
travelling with a certain politician. "It's all right, old boy,"
bubbled Ronny. "The War Office is quite calm about it now; we've got
'em stone-cold. Foch is in supreme command, and there are any number
of Divisions in reserve which haven't been called on. We're only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>waiting to know if this is the real push, or only a feint, and then we
strike. We've got 'em trapped, old top, no doubt about that."</p>

<p>"Right-o, strategist!" I retorted in the same vein.</p>

<p>"Do you want to buy a calf, old boy?" he switched off. "Look
here&mdash;there's one under the table. About 110 lbs. of meat at 3 francs
a pound. Dirt cheap these times. A Frenchman has left it with Madame
to sell. We'd buy it for our mess, but we've got a goose for dinner
to-night. Stay and dine with us, old boy."</p>

<p>Through the glass door that showed into the caf&eacute; one saw a little
group of civilians, dressed in their Sunday black, waiting for carts
to take them from the town. A mother was suckling a wailing child. An
old cripple nodded his head helplessly over hands propped up by his
stick. A smart young French soldier came in at the door, and Madame's
fair-haired daughter rushed to his arms and held him while she wept.
They talked fast, and the civilians listened with strained faces. "Her
fianc&eacute;," quietly explained an interpreter who came through the caf&eacute; to
join us in the "Officers only" room. "He's just come from Montdidier
with a motor-transport. He says he was fired at by machine-guns, which
shows that the Boche is still coming on."</p>

<p>The camp commandant of the Division, nervously business-like, the
baths' officer, D.A.D.O.S., and a couple of padres came in. The Camp
Commandant refused to hear of the colonel sleeping in a tent. "We've
got a big dormitory at the back here, sir&mdash;thirty wire-beds. We can
put all your Brigade Headquarter officers up." The colonel protested
that we should be quite happy in bivouacs, but he was overruled.</p>

<p>We dined in a tent in the waggon lines. As I made <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>my way there I
noticed a blue-painted motor-van, a mobile French wireless station,
some distance away in the fields. What really caught my eye when I
drew near it was a couple of Camembert cheeses, unopened and
unguarded, on the driver's seat. I bethought myself that the operator
inside the van might be persuaded to sell one of the cheeses. He
wasn't, but he was extremely agreeable, and showed me the evening
<i>communiqu&eacute;</i> that had just been "ticked" through. We became friends,
which explains why for three days I was able to inform the camp
commandant, Ronny Hertford, and all their party, of the latest
happenings at the Front, hours before the French newspapers and the
Continental 'Daily Mail' arrived.</p>

<p>And what do you think the men of two of our batteries were doing an
hour after the camps were pitched and the horses watered?&mdash;playing a
football match! Marvellous fellows!</p>

<p>We stayed at Estree until the evening of the 28th, days of gossip and
of fairly confident expectations, for we knew now that the Boche's
first offensive was held&mdash;but a time of waiting and of wondering where
we were to be sent next. Division was nearly thirty miles away,
incorporated with the French Army, and still fighting, while Corps
seemed to have forgotten that we needed supplies. Still there was no
need to worry about food and forage. Estree was an important railhead,
and the supply officer seemed anxious to get his stores distributed as
soon as they came in: he was prepared to treat most comers as
famine-stricken stragglers. Besides, near the station stood an
enormous granary, filled to the brim, simply waiting to be
requisitioned.</p>

<p>About noon on the 28th we were very cast down by the news that, to
meet the demand for reinforcements, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>the Brigade might be disbanded,
and the gunners hurried off in driblets, to make up losses on various
parts of our particular Army's front.</p>

<p>The colonel had instructions to attend a Staff Conference in the
afternoon, and each battery was ordered to prepare a list of its
available gunners.</p>

<p>There were sore hearts that afternoon. Many of the men had been with
the Brigade since it was formed, and to be scattered broadcast after
doing well, and coming through a time of stress and danger together,
would knock the spirit out of every one. The colonel came back at
tea-time, impassive, walking briskly. I knew before he opened his lips
that the Brigade was saved. "We move to-night to Pont St Maxence. We
are going on to Poix to refit," was all he said.</p>

<hr />

<p>Every one was anxious to be off, fearing that the Staff might change
its mind. It rained in torrents that night, and owing to the Corps'
failure to map out proper accommodation arrangements, we slept anyhow
and anywhere, but no one minded much. The Brigade was still in being,
and nothing else mattered. I could tell many stories of the next few
days&mdash;marching and billeting and getting ready for action again; of
the village that no English troops had visited before, and the
inhabitants that feared us, and afterwards did not want us to leave;
of the friendly bearded patron of an estaminet, who flourished an
'Echo de Paris,' and pointed to the words <i>t&eacute;nacit&eacute; anglaise</i> in an
account of the fighting; of the return of the signalling officer, who,
while attending a course at an Army School, had been roped in to lead
one of Sandeman Carey's infantry platoons; of the magnificently
equipped casualty clearing station that a week before the offensive
had been twenty-five miles behind <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>the lines, and only got its last
patients away two hours before the Boches arrived!</p>

<hr />

<p>April 2nd: A few more new guns had come in from the Refitting Depot.
We were almost complete to establishment. The horses were out grazing
and getting fat again. Most of the men were hard at it, playing their
eternal football. The colonel came out of the chateau, which was
Brigade Headquarters billet, and settled himself in a deck-chair. He
looked sun-tanned and fit.</p>

<p>"If all colonels were as competent and knowledgeable as our colonel,
we should have won the war by now," said Dumble as he and I walked
away. "What a beautiful day."</p>

<p>"Yes. Oh to be in England, now that April's here," I chimed in.</p>

<p>"Oh to be in England, any bally old time of the year," Dumble
corrected me.</p>

<h3>I. THE DEFENCE OF AMIENS<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />


<p>On a day towards the end of April the colonel and I, riding well ahead
of the Brigade, passed through deserted Amiens and stopped when we
came upon some fifty horses, nose-bags on, halted under the trees
along a boulevard in the eastern outskirts of the city. Officers in
groups stood beneath, or leaned against, the high wall of a large
civil hospital that flanked the roadway.</p>

<p>Reinforced in guns and personnel, and rested after the excitements and
hazards of the March thrust-back, our two brigades of Divisional Field
Artillery, and the D.A.C., were bound again for the Front. These
waiting officers formed the advance billeting parties.</p>

<p>"We've been obeying Sir Douglas Haig's Order of the Day&mdash;getting our
backs to the wall," growled the adjutant to me, after he had sprung up
and saluted the colonel. "The staff captain met us two hours ago at
&mdash;&mdash;; but they were shelling the place, and he said it wouldn't be
safe for waggon lines; so we came on here. He's inside the building
now seeing if he can put the whole Divisional Artillery there....</p>

<p>"I'll bet we shan't be ready for the batteries when they come in," he
went on gloomily&mdash;and then added, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>like the good soldier that he is,
"My groom will show you where the horses can water."</p>

<p>A long-range shell, passing high overhead and exploding among the
houses some way behind us, showed that Amiens was no health resort.
But horse lines were allotted, and in due course the long corridors of
the evacuated building resounded with the clatter-clatter of gunners
and drivers marched in to deposit their kits. "You've got a big piece
of chalk this morning, haven't you?" grumbled the adjutant to the
adjutant of our companion Brigade, complaining that they were
portioning off more rooms than they were entitled to. Still he was
pleased to find that the room he and I shared contained a wardrobe,
and that inside the door was pinned a grotesque, jolly-looking placard
of Harry Tate&mdash;moustache and all&mdash;in "Box o' Tricks." The discovery
that a currant cake, about as large as London, sent a few days before
from England, had disappeared from our Headquarters' mess-cart during
the day's march, led to a tirade on the shortcomings of New Army
servants. But he became sympathetic when I explained that the
caretakers, two sad-eyed French women, the only civilians we ourselves
met that day, were anxious that our men should be warned against
prising open locked doors and cupboards. "Tell 'em any man doing that
will be shot at dawn," he said, leaving me to reassure the women.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours later, after another march, our guns were in
position. With pick and shovel, and a fresh supply of corrugated iron,
the batteries were fortifying their habitations; Brigade Headquarters
occupied the only dwelling for miles round, a tiny caf&eacute; that no shell
had touched. The colonel had a ground-floor <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>room and a bedstead to
himself; the adjutant and myself put down our camp-beds in an attic,
with the signalling officer and the American doctor next door, and
H.Q. signallers and servants in the adjoining loft that completed the
upper storey. It was a rain-proof comfortable shelter, but the C.R.A.
didn't altogether approve of it. "You're at a cross-roads, with an
ammunition dump alongside of you, and the road outside the front door
is mined ready for blowing up should the Boche advance this way," he
said grimly, when he visited us. "In any case, he'll shoot by the map
on this spot immediately he starts a battle.... I think you ought to
have a retiring headquarters in readiness." So I put in two days
superintending the erection of a little colony of houses, built of
ammunition boxes and corrugated iron, half a mile from the main road.
I camouflaged the sloping roofs with loose hay, and, at a distance,
our "Garden City" looked like a bunch of small hay-stacks. We got
quite proud of our handiwork; and there was a strained moment one
midday when the regimental sergeant-major rode hurriedly to the caf&eacute;
with a most disturbing report. Riding along the main road he had
observed a party of men pulling down our huts, and piling the sheets
of corrugated iron into a G.S. waggon. When he cantered across, the
driver whipped up his horses, and the G.S. waggon bounded over the
open fields for half a mile before the sergeant-major got sufficiently
near to order it to halt. "They belong to the &nbsp;&mdash;st Brigade, sir," the
sergeant-major informed the adjutant, "and I've told the sergeant in
charge of the party to consider himself under arrest until you have
seen him."</p>

<p>The adjutant, eye flashing, nostrils dilated, was already out of the
caf&eacute; walking hard, and breathing dire threats <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>against the servant who
had been posted to guard our new home. Apparently he had gone away to
complain that the cook was late in sending his dinner.</p>

<p>The sergeant and his assistant "pirates" were restoring the dismantled
huts by the time the adjutant and myself drew near. The sergeant was
plainly a disciple of the "It's all in the same firm" school. He
submitted, with great respect, that he was innocent of criminal
intent. There was nothing to show that the huts were in use ... and
his battery wanted iron for their gun-pits.</p>

<p>"None of your old soldier talk with me," blustered the adjutant,
shaking a ponderous forefinger. "You knew you were doing wrong.... Why
did you send the waggon off when you saw the sergeant-major?"</p>

<p>"I went after it and stopped it when he told me to, sir," returned the
sergeant.</p>

<p>The sergeant-major admitted that, strictly speaking, this was a
correct statement. There was a ten seconds' pause, and I wondered what
the adjutant's next thrust would be.</p>

<p>"The waggon was trotting away, was it?" he demanded slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the sergeant.</p>

<p>"And you made no attempt to prevent it trotting until the
sergeant-major told you to stop it?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"And you know it's forbidden for waggons to be trotted except in very
exceptional circumstances?"</p>

<p>"Ye-s, sir."</p>

<p>"Very well, I put you under arrest for contravening G.R.O. by trotting
draught-horses."</p>

<p>"Artful beggar&mdash;I know him of old," chuckled the adjutant, as he and I
returned to the caf&eacute;. "He was <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>a gunner in my battery when I was
sergeant-major of &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; Battery, R.H.A."</p>

<p>The Boche was expected to attack on St George's Day. Our Brigade was
defending a reserve line, and would not fire unless the enemy swept
over our first-line system. Fresh trenches were being dug, and new and
stout rows of wire entanglement put down. Corps orders were distinct
and unmistakable. The fight here would be a fight <i>&agrave; outrance</i>. On
March 21 our retirement had been a strategic one. But this Front had
to be held at all costs, and we should throw in every reserve we had.
Only once during our stay in the caf&eacute; did the adjutant and myself
sleep in pyjamas. "These walls are so thin one 5&middot;9 would knock the
whole place out; if we have to clear we may as well be ready," he said
meaningly. The ridge, three-quarters of a mile in front of us, was
shelled regularly, and every night enemy bombing planes came over,
but, strangely enough, the Boche gunners neglected our cross-roads; we
even kicked a football about until one afternoon a trench-mortar
officer misdirected it on to the main road, and an expressive "pop!"
told of its finish under the wheel of a motor-lorry. St George's Day,
and still no Boche attack! We began to talk of the peaceful backwater
in which we were moored. Manning, our mess waiter, decorated the
stained, peeling walls of the mess with some New Art picture
post-cards. I found a quiet corner, and wrote out a 'Punch' idea that
a demand for our water-troughs to be camouflaged had put into my head.
Major Bullivant, who had succeeded poor Harville in the command of A
Battery, and Major Bartlett of C Battery, dined with us that night,
and the best story told concerned an extremely non-military subaltern,
newly attached to the D.A.C. When <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>instructed to deliver an important
message to "Div. Arty."&mdash;the Army condensation for "Divisional
Artillery"&mdash;he pored long and hopelessly over a map. Finally he
appealed to a brother officer. "I can't find the village of
'<span class="sc">Divarty</span>' on the map," he said, and, of course, sprang into
immediate fame throughout the Division.</p>

<p>April 24: About 4 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> a shell burst that shook the caf&eacute;.
Then the steady whistling scream of high-velocity shells going
overhead. I lighted a candle and looked at the adjutant as he poked
his red face and tousled grey hair from under his blankets. "They've
started," he muttered solemnly. "The old Hun always shells the back
areas when he attacks."</p>

<p>We got up slowly, and fastened boots and leggings. "I suppose we ought
to put on revolvers," he went on dubiously, and then added with sudden
warmth, "I hope he gets it in the neck to-day."</p>

<p>Our telephone pit in the cellar below the caf&eacute; was alive with
industry. Our batteries were not firing, but the colonel had already
asked the battery commanders whether any shells, particularly gas
shells, had come their way. A couple of 4&middot;2's had landed close to C
Battery, but they seemed to be stray shots; it did not seem likely
that the enemy knew where the batteries were sited. The Boche
bombardment continued.</p>

<p>After breakfast, a 5&middot;9 exploding 200 yards from our caf&eacute;, blew out the
largest pane in the unshuttered window. Shells had dropped by now in
most spots around us; but the cross-roads remained untouched. A
cyclist orderly from our waggon line, two miles back, brought news
that a direct hit had blown the telephone cart to bits; fortunately,
neither man nor horse had been touched. The adjutant was outside
exhorting four <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>infantry stragglers to try and find their units by
returning to the battle line. A Royal Fusilier, wounded in the head,
had fainted while waiting at the cross-roads for an ambulance; our
cook had lifted him on to a bench inside the caf&eacute; and was giving him
tea. The colonel, who remained in the mess, in telephone touch with
the brigadier-general, C.R.A., and the brigade-major, had never seemed
so preoccupied. Days afterwards, he confided to me that when the Hun
bombardment started he feared a repetition of the overpowering assault
of March 21.</p>

<p>"They had tanks out to-day," a boy captain of infantry, his arm in a
sling, told me, as he climbed into a motor ambulance. "By Gad, I saw a
topping sight near Villers Bretonneux. The Boche attacked in force
there and pushed us back, and one of his old tanks came sailing
merrily on. But just over the crest, near a sunken road, was a single
18-pdr.; it didn't fire until the Boche tank climbed into view on top
of the crest. Then they let him have it at about 100 yards' range.
Best series of upper-cuts I've ever seen. The old tank sheered off and
must have got it hot." I learnt afterwards that this was a single gun
detachment belonging to our companion brigade, who had been pushed
forward as soon as news came that the enemy was being held.</p>

<p>By tea-time we ourselves had been ordered forward to relieve a brigade
that had suffered considerably in the opening stages of the assault.
And, after all, we didn't occupy the "Garden City" headquarters I had
been at such pains to build. We handed it over to the brigade we were
relieving, and their colonel congratulated our colonel on his
forethought.</p>

<p>The colonel decided that only the doctor, the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>signalling officer, and
myself should go forward. The adjutant could settle at the waggon
lines and occupy himself with reinforcements, clothing, and salvage
returns, Army Form B 213, watering and forage arrangements, and
suchlike administrative duties. My task would be the "Forward" or "G"
branch&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, assisting the colonel with the details of his fighting
programmes.</p>

<p>The colonel and I lay down that night in a hole scooped out of a chalk
bank. The corrugated iron above our heads admitted a draught at only
one corner; as our sleeping-bags were spread out on a couple of spring
mattresses, moved by some one at some time from some neighbouring
homestead, we could not complain of lack of comfort.</p>

<p>April 24 was the last day on which our Brigade awaited and prepared to
meet a Boche attack of the first magnitude. But it was not until the
month of July that any of us conceived, or dared to believe in, the
possibility of his mighty armies being forced upon the defensive
again.</p>

<p>During May and June we accepted it that our r&ocirc;le would be to stick it
out until the Americans came along <i>en masse</i> in 1919. The swift and
glorious reversal of things from August onwards surprised no one more
than the actual fighting units of the British armies.</p>

<h3>II. THE RED-ROOFED HOUSE<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>"We're doing an attack to-morrow morning," said the colonel, returning
about tea-time from a visit to the C.R.A. "We are under the &nbsp;&mdash;th
Divisional Artillery while we're up here, and we shall get the orders
from them. You'd better let the batteries know. Don't say anything
over the wire, of course.... Any papers for me to see?" he added,
pulling out his leather cigarette case.</p>

<p>I handed him the gun and personnel returns, showing how many men and
guns the Brigade had in action; and the daily ammunition reports that
in collated form find their way from Divisional Artillery to Corps,
and from Corps to Army, and play their part in informing the strategic
minds at the back of the Front of the ebb and flow of fighting
activity all along the vast battle line, enabling them to shape their
plans accordingly. "D Battery are a bit low in smoke shells," remarked
the colonel. "You'd better warn Major Veasey that he'll want some for
to-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"B Battery ... two casualties ... how was that?" he continued, before
signing another paper.</p>

<p>"About an hour ago, sir. Their mess cart was coming up, and got
shelled half a mile from the battery position. Two of the servants
were wounded."</p>

<p>"I've never seen an order worded quite like that," <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>he smiled, when I
showed him a typed communication just arrived from the Divisional
Artillery, under whose orders we were now acting. It gave the map
co-ordinates of the stretch of front our guns were to fire upon in
response to S.O.S. calls. The passage the colonel referred to began&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"By kind consent of the colonel of the &nbsp;&mdash;th French Artillery,
the S.O.S. barrage on our front will be strengthened as
follows:..."</p></div>

<p>"Sounds as if the French colonel were lending his batteries like a
regimental band at a Bank Holiday sports meeting, sir," I ventured.</p>

<p>"Yes, we are learning to conduct war in the grand manner," smiled the
colonel, opening his copy of 'The Times.'</p>

<p>Our mess, under a couple of curved iron "elephants" stuck against the
bank, had looked a miserable affair when we came to it; but judicious
planting of sandbags and bits of "scrounged" boarding and a vigorous
clean-up had made it more habitable. Manning, the mess servant, had
unearthed from a disused dug-out a heavy handsome table with a
lacquered top, and a truly regal chair for the colonel&mdash;green plush
seating and a back of plush and scrolled oak&mdash;the kind of chair that
provincial photographers bring out for their most dignified sitters.
By the light of our acetylene lamp we had dined, and there had been
two rubbers of bridge, the colonel and the little American doctor
bringing about the downfall of Wilde, the signalling officer, and
myself, in spite of the doctor's tendency to finesse against his own
partner. The doctor had never played bridge before joining us, and his
mind still ran to poker. The Reconnaissance Officer of the &nbsp;&mdash;th
Divisional Artillery had rung up at 10 o'clock to tell us that an
officer <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>was on his way with a watch synchronised to Corps time, and
that we should receive orders for the next morning's operation <i>vi&acirc;</i> a
certain Field Artillery Brigade who were somewhere in our vicinity. I
had told the brigade clerk that he could go to bed in his 3 feet by 6
feet cubby-hole, and that the orderlies waiting to convey the battle
orders to the batteries ought to snatch some rest also. It was 11
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> now. Wilde and the doctor had gone off to their own
dug-out. It was very dark when I looked outside the mess. We were in a
lonely stretch of moorland; the nearest habitation was the
shell-mauled cottage at the railway crossing, two miles away. Every
ten minutes or so enemy shells screamed and flopped into the valley
between us and the road alongside which D Battery lay.</p>

<p>"We'll try and hurry these people up," said the colonel, picking up
the telephone. Even as he told the signaller on duty to get him
Divisional Artillery, a call came through. It was the Artillery
Brigade from whom we expected a messenger with the orders.</p>

<p>"No!" I heard the colonel say sharply. "We've had nothing.... No! no
one has been here with a watch.... You want an officer to come over to
you?... But I haven't any one who knows where you are."</p>

<p>A pause. Then the colonel continued. "Yes, but you know where we are,
don't you?... Umph.... Well, where are you to be found?... You can't
give a co-ordinate over the telephone?... That's not very helpful."</p>

<p>He rang off, but I knew by his expression that the matter was not yet
settled. He got through to the &nbsp;&mdash;th Divisional Artillery and told the
brigade-major that it was now 11.20 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>, that no officer
with a synchronised watch had arrived, and that the other brigade
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>were now asking us to send an officer to them for orders for the
coming battle. "I have no one who knows where they are," he went on.
"They must know our location&mdash;we relieved one of their brigades. Why
can't they send to us as arranged? I may have some one wandering about
half the night trying to find them."</p>

<p>In a little while the telephone bell tinkled again. "I'll answer
them," said the colonel abruptly.</p>

<p>"All right, I'll send to them," he replied stonily. "Where are we to
find them, since they won't give us co-ordinates over the
telephone?... A house with a red roof!... You can't tell us anything
more definite?... Very well.... Good-bye."</p>

<p>He put down the telephone with a little "Tchat!" that meant all forms
of protest, annoyance, and sense of grievance. But now that no
possible concession was to be gained, and certain precise work had to
be done by us, he became the inexorable matter-of-fact executive
leader again. "There's nothing for it," he said, looking at me. "You
will have to go."</p>

<p>Buildings with red roofs are not marked as such on military maps, and
I bent glumly over the map board. However, houses were exceedingly few
in this neighbourhood, and the chateau on the other side of the
railway could be ruled out immediately. It was known as "The White
Chateau," and I had noticed it in daytime. Besides, it had been so
heavily shelled that our companion brigade had evacuated it two days
before. "It's pretty certain to be somewhere in this area," observed
the colonel, bending over me, and indicating a particular three
thousand square yards on the map. "I expect that's the place&mdash;on the
other side of the railway," and he pointed to a tiny oblong patch. I
estimated that the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>house was three miles from where we were. It
wanted but five minutes to midnight.</p>

<p>I went outside, and flickering my electric torch stumbled across ruts
and past occasional shell-holes to the copse, three hundred yards
away, that sheltered the officers' chargers. I crackled a way among
twigs and undergrowth until the piquet called out, "Who goes there?"</p>

<p>"I think your groom's here, sir," he said, and the trees were so close
set that my shoulder brushed the hindquarters of a row of mules as he
piloted me along. "Are you there, Morgan?" he shouted, pulling open a
waterproof ground-sheet that was fastened over a hole in the ground.
"No&mdash;go away," called a voice angrily. "Where's Morgan sleep? Mr &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;
wants him," persevered the piquet.</p>

<p>We found my groom in another hole in the ground about thirty yards
away. He listened sleepily while I told him to get my horses ready
immediately. "Do you want feeds on, sir?" he asked, with visions
apparently of an all-night ride.</p>

<p>There was no moon, and I gazed gratefully at the only constellation
that showed in a damp unfriendly sky&mdash;the Great Bear. I let my horse
find his own way the first few hundred yards, until we struck a track,
then we broke into a trot. The swish and plop of gas shells in the
valley towards which we were descending made me pause. I calculated
that they were falling short of the railway crossing I wanted to
reach, and decided that a wide sweep to the right would be the safest
course. We cantered alongside some ploughed land, and the motion of
the horse, and the thought that with luck I might finish my task
quickly, and earn a word of commendation from the colonel, brought a
certain sense of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>exhilaration. The shelling of the valley increased;
my horse stumbled going down a bank, and for the next five minutes we
walked over broken ground. "Getting a bit too much to the right," I
said to myself, and turned my horse's head. Further thoughts were cut
short by the discovery that his forelegs were up against a belt of
barbed wire.</p>

<p>For ten minutes I walked in front of the wire, searching for an
opening, and getting nearer to where the shells were falling. All the
time I looked earnestly for the railway line. I began to feel bitter
and resentful. "If our own Divisional Artillery had been doing
to-morrow's show I shouldn't have had to turn out on a job of this
kind," I reflected. "Damn the &nbsp;&mdash;th Division. Why can't they do their
work properly?"</p>

<p>But little gusts of anger sometimes bring with them the extra bit of
energy that carries a job through. We had reached a ruined wall now,
and there was still no opening in the wire. I could see telegraph
posts, and knew that the railway was just ahead. I got off my horse,
told the groom to wait behind the broken wall, and, climbing through
the barbed wire, picked my way along smashed sleepers and twisted
rails until I came to the crossing.</p>

<p>I followed the deserted shell-torn road that led from the
level-crossing, searching for a track on the left that would lead to
the house I sought. A motor-cyclist, with the blue-and-white band of
the Signal Service round his arm, came through the hedge.</p>

<p>"Is there a house on top of that hill?" I asked him, after a
preliminary flicker of my torch.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Is it a red-roofed house?"</p>

<p>"Well, ... I don't know, sir."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>"Who's up there?"</p>

<p>"Smith's group, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh, hang! that tells me nothing. What are they&mdash;artillery?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir&mdash;heavies, I think, sir."</p>

<p>I felt myself at a standstill. Orders for us were not likely to be
with a group of heavy artillery. "Whom are you from?" I asked finally,
preparing to move on.</p>

<p>"From the &nbsp;&mdash;th Div. Artillery, sir."</p>

<p>"Oh!"&mdash;with a rush of hopefulness&mdash;"you have no orders, I suppose, for
the &nbsp;&mdash;nd Brigade?"&mdash;mentioning our Brigade.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>I broke off and strode up the hillside, determined at any rate to
gather some sort of information from the house the motor-cyclist had
just left. I came upon a bare-looking, two-storied brick building with
plain doors and windows. Through the keyhole of the front door I could
see a light coming from an inside room. I opened the door and walked
down the passage, calling, "Is this the &nbsp;&mdash;rd Field Artillery Brigade?"</p>

<p>"No! This is the &nbsp;&mdash;nd Field Company," replied a fair-moustached sapper
captain, who was lying on a mattress in the room from which the light
came, reading a book of O. Henry stories.</p>

<p>"Sorry to trouble you," I said, "but I'm trying to find the &nbsp;&mdash;rd
Brigade. Do you know if they are round here?"</p>

<p>"I don't, I'm afraid. We only came in this afternoon."</p>

<p>"It's a house with a red roof," I went on, rather hopelessly.</p>

<p>"I think I know the place," chimed in a voice from an inner room.
"It's a shooting-box, isn't it? Your <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>best way is to get on the road
again and take the next track on the left. I noticed a red-roofed
house up there when we came by."</p>

<p>I trudged back and got on to the new track, feeling very martyred but
very resigned. I suppose I ought to have kept my eyes open more, I
thought. Next time I go to a new part of the country I won't miss a
single distinguishing feature.</p>

<p>It was now 1.15 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> I came to a lonely house fronted by a
neatly railed garden. I hammered noisily on the door and found that it
opened into a darkened passage. A torch flashed into my face. "Is this
the &nbsp;&mdash;rd Brigade?" I began.</p>

<p>"Yes," a voice shouted, and suddenly a door opened and a spurt of
light revealed a youthful pink-cheeked staff lieutenant. "Are you from
the &nbsp;&mdash;nd Brigade?" he asked. "Oh, bon! bon!&mdash;I've been waiting for
you."</p>

<p>"Waiting for me!" I retorted, nettled by his airy manner. "Hard luck
on me having to traipse at this time of night to a place I don't know
to get orders you ought to have sent out."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," he replied cheerfully. "We're awfully sorry, but it's
the French Division, you know. We've only just got the orders out of
them. It's really their show.... And I'm afraid the first part of your
orders have been sent off to the wrong place." Saying which, he led me
into a large sombre room in which four or five officers sat immersed
in papers and message forms. An elderly colonel looked up and nodded
over his glasses. The young staff officer handed me some barrage maps
and a quantity of type-written operation orders.</p>

<p>"Zero hour is 5.10 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>," he began, "and here is the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>part of
your orders that has gone astray. I can't give you this copy. Will you
take the orders down from this?"</p>

<p>I commenced writing out the operation order, and was struck to find
that the barrage "lifts" were in hundreds of metres instead of
hundreds of yards. "Yes, the French insisted on that," explained the
staff lieutenant briskly.</p>

<p>"But we haven't metres on our range-drums," I said with an air of
abandonment.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, but the French insisted on it, because of their
infantry.... Oh! there's a para. there about smoke-shells&mdash;that's
important."</p>

<p>"The para. about smoke-shells is deleted ... there will be no
smoke-shells," put in the elderly colonel, looking up.</p>

<p>"Oh, is it, sir?" said the staff lieutenant, turning round.</p>

<p>"Yes; the correction has just come through."</p>

<p>"Right, sir."</p>

<p>I synchronised my watch, thrust the bundle of papers into my
hip-pocket, and hurried away to find my horses. It was half-past one,
and the attack was timed to start at 5.10. The colonel would require
to deal with the orders, and the battery commanders would have but the
barest time to work out their individual "lifts." I started back at
the gallop, skirting the side of the valley. I remember wishing to
heaven that the clumps and hillocks of this part of France did not
look so consistently alike. If only it were light enough for me to
pick out the mustard field that lay, a bright yellow landmark, behind
our chalk bank!</p>

<p>The colonel was in bed when I got back, but I held a candle while he
read through the orders, and got out his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>ivory ruler, and apportioned
a barrage lane to each battery. "Metres will have to become yards,"
was one of his remarks.</p>

<p>By twenty-to-three the orderlies had set out with the battle orders to
the batteries, while I spoke on the telephone to an officer of each
battery, and synchronised watches.</p>

<p>When I turned in, after a whisky-and-soda and a couple of biscuits,
the colonel was fast asleep. I felt satisfied, however, that I had
done my share that night towards beating the Hun.</p>

<p>By 7 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> we were up again, and until 7 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> the
telephone buzzed continuously. It was a day of hard infantry fighting,
of attacks that were held up and had to be renewed, of German
counter-efforts to shift us from points won at the opening of our
attack. All day long F.O.O.'s and liaison officers telephoned reports
of changes in our front line, and five times I turned on our batteries
to respond to S.O.S. calls. By the end of the day we held three parts
of the ground that our Higher Command had planned to seize.</p>

<h3>III. AN AUSTRALIAN "HAND-OVER"<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>There followed three months of varied kinds of soldiering: short
spells holding the line, odd days in rest areas, quick shifts to other
parts of the Front, occasional participation in carefully prepared
raids on Hun trenches, one whole fortnight in a riverside village
where even the Boche night-bombers did not come, and where we held a
joyous race-meeting&mdash;seventy riders in one race&mdash;and a spit-and-polish
horse show. There was the fresh burst by the Hun armies that seemed to
spell the doom of Reims. We began to notice larger and larger bodies
of arriving Americans, but did not expect them to be in the war on an
impressive scale until 1918 was out. Leave to England remained at a
standstill. The universal phrase of 1916 and 1917, "Roll on Duration,"
had almost entirely disappeared from the men's letters that came
before me for censoring. Yet no one seemed depressed. Every one
appeared possessed of a sane and calm belief that things would work
out right in the long-run. We should just have to hold the Hun off
this year, and by honest endeavour during training opportunities fit
ourselves to fight with added effectiveness in 1919, when America
would be properly in the field and the Allies' turn would come.</p>

<p>The second week in May the Brigade, after a fourteen-mile march, came
again into the land of rolling heights <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>and sunken roads in which for
three and a half years most of our fighting had been done. A "sausage"
balloon anchored to the ground, a pumping-station and four
square-shaped water-troughs, and a dozen or so shanties built of
sandbags and rusted iron, dotted the green-and-brown landscape.</p>

<p>Waggon tracks had cut ugly brown ways through clover-fields and
grasslands. A new system of trenches stretched to north and to south
from the main road along which the Brigade were moving. Men of the
Labour Corps were stolidly filling shell-holes in the road surface
with broken stones, and digging sump-holes for draining away the
rain-and-mud torrents that were sure to come. A long dark wood crowned
the ridge three miles in front of us. In the centre a slender spire
tipped the tree-tops.</p>

<p>"That's Baisieux Church," said Major Bullivant, with whom I was riding
along the horse track at the side of the road. "Do you know the latest
motto for the Labour Corps?" he added inconsequentially, looking down
at a bespectacled man in khaki who eased up as we passed. "<i>Infra
dig.</i>," he went on, with a humorous side-glance, and without pausing
for my answer.</p>

<p>Away to the east muffled boomings as if giants were shaking blankets.
My mind turned to July 1916, when first I arrived in France and came
along this very road at 3.30 one morning as the sun's rim began to
peep above the long dark wood. How easy to recall that morning! I had
brought fifty-three men from the Base, reinforcements for the
Divisional Artillery, and half-believed that the war could not proceed
unless I delivered them to their destination in the shortest possible
time; and my indignant keenness when I reached the village <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>behind the
long dark wood and learned that no one there knew anything about the
two lorries that were to transport my party the remainder of the
journey to the Front! Did I not rouse a frowning town major and two
amazed sergeant-majors before 5 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> and demand that they
should do something in the matter? And did not my fifty-three men
eventually complete a triumphant pilgrimage in no fewer than thirteen
ammunition lorries&mdash;to find that they and myself had arrived a day
earlier than we were expected? And here was I again in the same
stretch of country, and the British line not so far forward as it had
been two years before.</p>

<p>We pitched tents and tethered our horses in the wood, and before
nightfall I walked into the village to look at the spot beneath the
church tower where I had halted my fifty-three men, and to view again
the barn in which I had roused the most helpful of the two
sergeant-majors. Alas for the sentiment! All French villages seem much
alike, with their mud-wall barns and tiled cottages, when you have
passed through scores of them, as I have done since July 1916. I could
not be certain of the building.</p>

<p>Coming back to our camp through the heart of the wood, I chanced upon
a place of worship that only a being of fancy and imagination and
devoutness could have fashioned. Inside a high oval hedge, close-woven
with much patient labour, stood an altar made of banked-up turf,
surmounted by a plain wooden cross. Turf benches to seat a hundred and
fifty worshippers faced the altar. Above, the wind rustled softly
through the branches of tall birches and larch trees, bent over until
they touched, and made one think of Gothic arches. There was wonderful
peace and rest in the place. Some <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>one told me afterwards that the
chaplain of a London Division had built it. It was a happy thought.</p>

<hr />

<p>In the morning I went with the colonel through the village, and a mile
and a half along a road leading east that for half a mile was lined
with camouflage screens. "The Boche holds the ridge over there,"
remarked the colonel, stretching an arm towards high ground swathed in
a blue haze five miles away. A painted notice-board told all and
sundry that horse traffic was not permitted on the road until after
dusk. We struck off to the left, dropped into a trench where we saw a
red triangular flag flying, and said "Good-day" to the brigade-major
of the Infantry brigade who had made their headquarters at this spot.
Then we got out of the trench again, and walked along the top until we
came to what was to be our future home&mdash;the headquarters of the
Australian Field Artillery Brigade that we were to relieve by 10
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> We received a cheery welcome from a plump, youngish
Australian colonel, and a fair-haired adjutant with blue sparkling
eyes.</p>

<p>When a brigade of artillery relieves another brigade of artillery,
there is a ceremony, known as "handing-over," to be gone through. The
outgoing brigade presents to the in-coming brigade maps and documents
showing the positions of the batteries, the O.P.'s, the liaison duties
with the infantry, the amount of ammunition to be kept at the gun
positions, the zones covered, the S.O.S. arrangements, and similar
information detailing daily work and responsibilities. I can recall no
"hand-over" so perfect in its way as this one. The Australian
Brigade's defence file was a beautifully arranged, typed document, and
a child could have understood the indexing. True, the extent and
number <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>of their headquarters staff was astonishing. Against our two
clerks they had three clerks, and a skilled draughtsman for
map-making; also an N.C.O. whose sole <i>magnum opus</i> was the weekly
compiling of Army Form B. 213. But there could be no doubt that they
carried on war in a most business-like way.</p>

<p>The colonel went off with the Australian colonel to inspect the
battery positions and view the front line from the O.P.'s, and sent me
back to bring up our mess cart and to arrange for the fetching of our
kit. By tea-time we were properly installed; and indeed the Australian
colonel and his adjutant remained as our guests at dinner.</p>

<p>The mess, cut out of the side of the trench and lined with corrugated
iron, possessed an ingeniously manufactured door&mdash;part of a drum-tight
wing of a French aeroplane. The officers' sleeping quarters were
thirty feet below ground, in an old French dug-out, with steps so
unequal in height that it was the prudent course to descend backwards
with your hands grasping the steps nearest your chin.</p>

<p>The Australian colonel dipped his hand for the fifth time into the box
of canteen chocolates that Manning had placed on the table with the
port. "That's a nice Sam Browne of yours," he observed, noticing the
gloss on our adjutant's belt.</p>

<p>"I hope you don't take a fancy to it, sir," replied our adjutant
quickly. "We're all afraid of you, you know. I've put a double piquet
on our waggon lines for fear some of your fellows take a liking to our
horses."</p>

<p>The Australian colonel and his adjutant laughed good-naturedly, and
the colonel told us a story of a captain and a sergeant-major in
another Australian brigade who were accomplished "looters."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>One night the pair were hauling down a tent which they thought was
empty, when a yell made them aware that an officer was sleeping in it.
The captain took to his heels, but the sergeant-major was captured.</p>

<p>"The next day," concluded the Australian colonel, "the captain had to
go and make all sorts of apologies to get his sergeant-major off. The
other people agreed, provided the officer ransomed him with half a
dozen pit-props and ten sheets of corrugated iron. For a long time
afterwards we used to chaff the captain, and tell him that he valued
his sergeant-major at six pit-props and ten sheets of iron."</p>

<p>Hot sweltering days followed. Most mornings I spent at the O.P.
watching our batteries' efforts to knock out suspected enemy trench
mortars, or staring through my binoculars trying to pick out Boche
transport, or fresh digging operations. The tramp back at midday along
the communication trenches was boiling-hot going. I used to think
"People working in London will be pining just now for green fields and
country air. For myself, I'd give anything for a cool ride on a London
bus." In the afternoons there were reserve battery positions&mdash;in case
of a swift Hun advance&mdash;to be reconnoitred, gaps in the barbed-wire
systems to be located, and bits of trenches that would have to be
filled in to allow our waggons to cross. Divisional Artillery were
insistent upon timed reports of hostile shelling, particularly gas
shelling, and this formed another portion of my special work. One day
intimation came from Division that Fentiman and Robson had been
accepted for the Air Service. "It's the only way to get leave to
England," said Robson jocularly. Fentiman's chief regret was that he
would have to leave behind a mare that he had got from the Tank Corps.
"She pulls so," he told me one <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>afternoon when I met him jogging along
the road, "that if I turned on to the grass at this moment and put
spurs into her, she wouldn't stop till she got to Amiens.... No one in
the Tank Corps has been able to pull her up under four miles, and only
then when she came to a seven-foot hedge.... But I was beginning to
understand her."</p>

<p>When I accompanied the colonel on his visits to the Infantry brigades
all the talk was of the training of the youngsters, who now formed so
considerable a portion of the battalion strengths. "They are good
stuff," I heard one of the brigadiers say, "and I keep drumming into
them that they are fighting for England, and that the Boche mustn't
gain another yard of ground." He was a fighter, this
brigadier&mdash;although I have never yet met another officer who took it
as a matter of course that his camp-bed should be equipped with linen
sheets when he was living in the firing line.</p>

<p>About three-quarters of a mile from our headquarters was a tiny
cemetery, set in a grove of trees on a bare hillside, sequestered,
beautiful in its peacefulness and quiet. One morning, very early, I
walked out to view it more closely. It had escaped severe shelling,
although chipped tombstones and broken railings and scattered pieces
of painted wire wreaths showed that the hell-blast of destruction had
not altogether passed it by. I went softly into the little chapel. On
the floor, muddy, noisy-sleeping soldiers lay sprawled in ungainly
attitudes. Rifles were piled against the wall; mess-tins and
water-bottles lay even upon the altar. And somehow there seemed
nothing incongruous about the spectacle, nothing that would hurt a
profoundly religious mind. It was all part of the war.</p>

<p>And one night when I was restless, and even the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>heavy drugging warmth
of the dug-out did not dull me to sleep, I climbed up into the open
air. It was a lovely night. The long dark wood stood out black and
distinct in the clear moonlight; the stars twinkled in their calm
abode. Suddenly a near-by battery of long-range guns cracked out an
ear-splitting salvo. And before the desolating rush of the shells had
faded from the ear a nightingale hidden among the trees burst into
song. That also was part of the war.</p>

<h3>IV. HAPPY DAYS!<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>During the month of June Brigade Headquarters retired from the trench
dug-out and settled in the end house of the village, a white-walled,
vine-clad building, with a courtyard and stables and a neat garden
that only one Boche shell had smitten. On the door of the large room
that we chose for the mess there still remained a request in French,
written in a clear painstaking hand, that billeted officers should
keep to the linoleum strips laid across the carpet when proceeding to
the two inner rooms. But there was no linoleum now, and no carpet. On
the otherwise bare wall was hung a massively-framed portrait of the
proprietor&mdash;a clean-shaven middle-aged Frenchman of obviously high
intelligence. A family press-cutting album contained an underlined
report from a local newspaper of a concert given in the village on
June 6, 1914:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p><i>Tr&egrave;s remarque le duo de mandoline avec accompagnement de violon
ex&eacute;cut&eacute; par trois gracieuses jeunes filles qui font &agrave; chacune de
nos soir&eacute;es admirer par les amateurs du beau, leur talent
d'artiste!</i></p></div>

<p>I gathered that the three young girls were daughters of the house; I
also noted that <i>trois gracieuses jeunes filles</i> was doubly
underlined.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>One of our servants used to be a professional gardener, and in a
couple of days he had weeded the paths and brought skill and knowledge
to bear on the neglected vegetable beds. We had excellent salad from
that garden and fresh strawberries, while there were roses to spare
for the tall vases on the mantelpiece in the mess; and before we came
away our gardener had looked to the future and planted lettuce and
turnips and leeks, and even English pansies. The Boche gunners never
got a line on to that house, and though aeroplanes cruised above us
every night not a single bomb dropped near.</p>

<p>The town major, a learned and discursive subaltern, relieved on
account of rheumatic troubles from more strenuous duties with an
Infantry regiment, joined our mess and proved a valuable addition. He
was a talented mathematician whose researches had carried him to where
mathematics soar into the realms of imagination; he had a horror of
misplaced relatives, and possessed a reliable palate in the matter of
red wines. One dinner-time he talked himself out on the possibilities
of the metric system, and pictured the effects of a right angle with a
hundred instead of ninety degrees. Another night he walked me up and
down the garden until 2 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>, expatiating on astronomy. He
tried to make me realise the beyond comprehension remoteness of the
new star by explaining that astronomers did not calculate its distance
from the earth in thousands of miles. "Light travels at 186,000 miles
a second; to astronomers the new star is 2000 years away," he
concluded.</p>

<p>As I have said, he was a valuable addition to our mess. One day he
took me to a neighbouring village and introduced me to a fat
comfortable-looking Maire, who spread his hands on his capacious knees
and invited us to try a cooling nip of absinthe. After which he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>produced from a small choice store a bottle of fifty-year-old brandy,
and made the town major take it away in token of a friendship that
began in the way-back days of 1915.</p>

<p>All this may not sound like war, but I am trying to write down some of
the average daily happenings in a field-artillery brigade that has
seen as much service as any brigade in the new armies.</p>

<p>For several days Wilde, the signalling officer, and the doctor
conducted an acrid argument that arose from the doctor's astounding
assertion that he had seen a Philadelphia base-ball player smite a
base-ball so clean and hard that it travelled 400 yards before it
pitched. Wilde, with supreme scorn, pointed out that no such claim had
been made even for a golf ball. The doctor made play with the names of
Speaker, Cobb, and other transatlantic celebrities. Then one day Wilde
rushed into the mess flourishing a London Sunday paper that referred
in glowing terms to a mighty base-ball hit of 136 yards, made on the
Royal Arsenal football ground; after which the doctor retired to cope
with the plague of boils that had descended upon the Brigade. This and
a severe outbreak of Spanish 'flue provided him with a regular hundred
patients a day. He himself had bitter personal experience of the
boils. We never saw him without one for ten weeks. His own method of
dealing with their excruciating tenderness was to swathe his face in
cotton-wool and sticking-plaster. "Damn me, doctor, if you don't look
like a loose imitation of Von Tirpitz," burst out the adjutant one
day, when the doctor, with a large boil on either side of his chin,
appeared plastered accordingly.</p>

<p>By July we had side-stepped north and were housed in a chateau that
really deserved the appellation, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>though it was far from being as
massively built as an average English country seat of like importance.
It belonged to one of the oldest families in France. Wide noble
staircases led to vast rooms made untenable by shell fire. Fragments
of rare stained glass littered the vacant private chapel. The most
valuable paintings, the best of the Louis XV. furniture, and the
choicest tapestry had been removed to safety. In one room I entered
some bucolic wag had clothed a bust of Venus in a lance-corporal's cap
and field-service jacket, and affixed a box-respirator in the alert
position. We made the mess in what had been the nursery, and the
adjutant and myself slept in bunks off an elaborately mined passage,
in making which British tunnellers had worked so hard that cracks
showed in the wall above, and the whole wing appeared undecided
whether or not to sink. We learned that there were two schools of
opinion regarding the safety of the passage. The Engineers of one
Division thought the wing would not subside; some equally competent
Engineers shook their heads and said no civil authority would dream of
passing the passage as safe. The adjutant and myself relied upon the
optimists; at any rate, we should be safe from the Hun gunners, who
treated the chateau as one of their datum points.</p>

<p>We were relieving an Army Field Artillery brigade commanded by a
well-known scientific gunner, and on the afternoon that we arrived he
took the colonel and myself on an explanatory tour of the battery
positions and the "O.P.'s." They were leaving their guns in position
for us to use. There was a Corps standing order that steel helmets
should be worn and box-respirators kept in the alert position in this
part of the line. So first we girded up ourselves in compliance <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>with
orders. Then our guide made us walk in single file and keep close to
the houses as we walked along the main street. "He has a beautiful
view of the chateau gates and can see movement in the centre of the
road," he informed us.</p>

<p>It was a terribly battered village. The church tower had been knocked
out of shape. Roofs that had escaped being smashed in were threadbare,
or seemed to be slipping off skeleton houses. Mutilated
telegraph-poles and broken straggly wires, evil-smelling pools of
water, scattered bricks, torn roadways, and walls blackened and
scarred by bomb and shell, completed a scene of mournfulness and
desolation. We passed one corner house on the shutters of which some
"infanteers" had chalked the inviting saucy sign, "Ben Jonson's Caf&eacute;."
Then we struck across a fast-ripening wheat-field and put up a mother
partridge who was agonised with fear lest we should discover her young
ones. "It will be a pity if these crops can't be gathered in,"
remarked our colonel. To right and left of us, and beyond the ruined
village that lay immediately in front, were yellow fields ready for
the harvesters. "Does he shell much?" continued the colonel.</p>

<p>"Not consistently," replied the other colonel. "I don't think he does
much observed shooting. He's copying our method of sudden bursts of
fire, though."</p>

<p>We inspected two O.P.'s on one side of the wide valley that led
towards the front line, picked up, through binoculars, the chief
reference points in Bocheland, and had a look at two
heavily-camouflaged anti-tank guns that were a feature of the defence
in this part of the front. Myriads of fat overfed flies buzzed in the
trenches through which we passed. Hot and dusty, we came back about 6
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>, and entered <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>the chateau kitchen-garden through a hole
that had been knocked in the high, ancient, russet-red brick wall. The
sudden scent of box and of sweet-smelling herbs roused a tingling
sense of pleasure and of recollection. I never failed afterwards to
return to the chateau by that way.</p>

<p>The other colonel came out with us again next morning, although our
batteries were now in possession, and his own officers and men had
gone a long way back. He wanted to show our colonel some observation
points from the O.P. on the other side of the valley.</p>

<p>A certain incident resulted. As we passed A Battery's position we saw
Dumble, the battery captain, looking through the dial-sight of his No.
1 gun, apparently trying to discover whether a black-and-white
signalling-pole, planted fifty yards in front of the gun, was in line
with a piece of hop-pole fifty yards farther on. Both colonels stared
fixedly at the spectacle. "What's become of the aiming-posts?" said
the other colonel, puzzled and stern.</p>

<p>When a gun has fired satisfactorily on a certain target, which is also
a well-defined point on the map, and it is desired to make this
particular line of fire the standard line, or, as it is commonly
called, the zero line, the normal method is to align two aiming-posts
with such accuracy that, no matter what other targets are fired upon,
the gun can always be brought back to its zero line by means of the
aiming-posts. Absolute accuracy being essential, the aiming-posts are
specially designed and are of a settled pattern. Judge of the two
colonels' astonishment then when they perceived Dumble's impromptu
contrivance.</p>

<p>"Have you no aiming-posts?" our colonel asked Dumble sharply.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>"No, sir, the other battery would not leave theirs behind. I had
understood it was arranged that we should hand over ours at the waggon
line, and that they should leave theirs here to give us the lines of
fire."</p>

<p>"Of course," interrupted the other colonel; "but what are you doing
now? You can't get your line with those things."</p>

<p>"I'm trying to do the best I can, sir, until my own aiming-posts
arrive."</p>

<p>"Yes, but it's hopeless trying to fix those ridiculous things in the
same positions as the aiming-posts. Who was it gave the order to
remove the aiming-posts?"</p>

<p>"The subaltern who was waiting for us to relieve your battery, sir."</p>

<p>"The battery commander wasn't here then?"</p>

<p>"No, sir. I believe he'd gone on ahead to the waggon lines."</p>

<p>"I'm exceedingly sorry this has happened," said the other colonel,
turning to our colonel. "I'll have the battery commander and the other
officer up here at once, and they can go forward with your officer
when he registers the guns again. It's disgraceful. I'll stop their
next leave for this." He disappeared into the battery telephone pit to
send through orders for the recalling of the delinquent officers.</p>

<p>"Not a bad idea to make an inspection round the day after you have
handed over," remarked our colonel to me drily. "This is rather an
instructive example."</p>

<p>These were our last days of waiting and wondering whether the Boche
would attack; of the artillery duels and the minor raids by which each
side sought to feel and test the other's strength. I recall two or
three further <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>incidents of our stay in that part of the line. The
G.O.C., R.A., of Corps decided that a rare opportunity presented
itself for training junior officers in quick picking up of targets,
shooting over open sights, and voice-command of batteries from near
sighting-places where telephone wires could be dispensed with and
orders shouted through a megaphone. "It will quite likely come to
that," he observed. "The next fighting will be of the real open
warfare type, and the value of almost mechanical acquaintance with
drill is that the officer possessing such knowledge can use all his
spare brains to deal with the changing phases of the actual battle."
So a single 18-pdr. used to be pulled out for practice purposes, and
Generals and infantry officers came to see gunner subalterns schooled
and tested. It was better practice than Shoeburyness or Larkhill,
because though the shoots were carried out on the gunnery school model
the shells were directed at real targets. During one series a
distinguished red-tabbed party was dispersed because the Hun did an
area strafe in front, behind, and around the single gun. Another time
the descent of an 8-inch saved the <i>amour-propre</i> of a worried second
lieutenant, who, after jockeying with his angle of sight, had got into
abject difficulties with his range and corrector.</p>

<p>One morning I was up forward carrying out instructions to keep in
daily touch with the infantry battalions, finding out their
requirements, and discovering what new artillery targets they could
suggest. As it was also my business to know what the Heavies were
doing, I stopped at an O.P. in a trench to ask a very young R.G.A.
officer observing for a 6-inch how. such questions as what he had
fired upon that morning, and whether he had noted any fresh Boche
movement. I had passed along the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>winding trench and descended the
dug-out headquarters of one of our infantry battalions, and was
inquiring if the commanding officer had any suggestions or complaints
to make, when the boyish R.G.A. officer came down the steps and, not
noticing me in the dim candle-light, asked in hurried tones: "Excuse
me, sir, but could you identify an artillery officer who said he was
coming here? He stopped and asked me some extraordinary questions ...
and"&mdash;hesitatingly&mdash;"you have to be careful talking to people in the
front line."</p>

<p>The adjutant and the intelligence officer of the infantry battalion
were smiling broadly. Finally the colonel had to laugh. "Yes," he
said, "I can identify the artillery officer. Here he is. You haven't
discovered a spy this time."</p>

<p>The young officer looked abashed, and when later I passed his "O.P.,"
apologised with much sincerity. I replied by asking him to have a good
look at me, so that he wouldn't mistake me next time we met. After
which we both laughed. We did meet again, not long afterwards, and in
much more exciting circumstances.</p>

<p>When the Brigade left that part of the line, Marshal Foch had begun
his momentous counter-effort between Soissons and Ch&acirc;teau-Thierry. In
a very short time we also were to be engaged in a swift and eventful
movement that changed the whole tenor of the war: a time of hard
ceaseless fighting, countless episodes of heroism and sacrifice, and
vivid conquering achievement.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span><br />

<h3>V. BEFORE THE GREAT ATTACK<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>On the evening of August 3, an evening with a sinister lowering sky,
we settled in our newest headquarters: wooden huts, perched on the
long steep slope of a quarry just outside the crumbling ruins of
Heilly, celebrated in the war annals of 1916 for an officers'
tea-rooms, where three pretty daughters of the house acted as
waitresses.</p>

<p>Excitement was in the air. Marshal Foch's bold strategy at Soissons
had had dramatic effect. The initiative was passing again to the
Allies. A faint rumour had developed into an official fact. There was
to be a big attack on our immediate front. Yet few of us dared to
conceive the mark in history that August 8 was to make. All we really
hoped for was a series of stout resolute operations that would bring
Germany's great offensive to a deadlock.</p>

<p>Along the road that wound past the quarry&mdash;offshoot of a main route
that will for ever be associated with the War&mdash;there flowed a
ceaseless stream of ammunition waggons. "This goes on for three
nights.... My Gad, they're getting something ready for him," remarked
our new adjutant to me. Gallant, red-faced, roaring old Castle had
been transferred to command the Small Arms Ammunition section of the
D.A.C., where his love of horses was given full play, and had already
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>gained his section many prizes at our Horse Show a week before.</p>

<p>Rain descended in stinging torrents, and the Australian colonel and
his adjutant, who would leave as soon as they heard that our batteries
had relieved theirs, looked out disgustedly. I called for a bottle of
whisky, and when the Australian adjutant toasted me with "Here's to
the skin of your nose," I gathered that his gloom was lessening. The
soup came in and we started dinner.</p>

<p>Talk ran upon the extraordinary precautions taken to surprise the
enemy. Field-guns were not to be moved up to their battle positions
until the night before the attack. There was to be no digging in of
guns, no earth was to be upturned. Reconnaissance likely to come under
enemy observation had to be carried out with a minimum of movement. As
few officers and men as was possible were to be made aware of the date
and the scope of the operation. On a still night the creaking rattle
of ammunition waggons on the move may be heard a very long way off. To
prevent this noise of movement wheel tyres were lapped with rope; the
play of the wheels was muffled by the use of leather washers. Straw
had even to be laid on some of the roads&mdash;as straw is laid in front of
houses where the seriously sick are lying.</p>

<p>"I think," said the Australian signalling officer, "that the funniest
thing is the suggestion in orders that telephone conversations should
be camouflaged. I suppose that if some indiscreet individual asks over
the 'phone whether, for instance, a new telephone line has been laid
to a certain map point it is advisable to reply, 'No, he's dining out
to-night.'"</p>

<p>"Why not try a whistling code?" put in our adjutant. "Suppose you
whistled the first line of 'Where my <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>Caravan has rested,' that could
mean 'At the waggon line.'"</p>

<p>"And 'Tell me the old, old Story' would be 'Send in your ammunition
returns at once,'" laughed Wilde, our signalling officer, who had been
angered many times because his line to Divisional Artillery had been
held up for that purpose.</p>

<p>"And 'It's a long way to Tipperary' could be taken as 'Lengthen your
Range,'" said one of the Australian officers in his soft drawl; while
the exuberance reached its climax when some one suggested that
"Waiting for the Robert E. Lee" might be whistled to indicate that the
Divisional Commander was expected at any moment.</p>

<p>"You've had some of the Americans with you, haven't you?" asked our
colonel of the Australian colonel. "How do you find them? We heard a
humorous report that some of the Australian infantry were rather
startled by their bloodthirstiness and the vigour of their language."</p>

<p>The Australian colonel&mdash;one of those big, ugly, good-tempered men who
attract friendship&mdash;laughed and replied, "I did hear one good story. A
slightly wounded Boche was being carried on a stretcher to the
dressing station by an American and one of our men. The Boche spoke a
bit of English, and was talkative. 'English no good,' he said. 'French
no good, Americans no good.' The stretcher-bearers walked on without
answering. The Boche began again. 'The English think they're going to
win the war,&mdash;they're wrong. You Americans think you've come to
win,&mdash;you're wrong.'</p>

<p>"Then the American spoke for the first and last time. 'You think
you're going to be carried to hospital,&mdash;you're wrong. Put him down,
Digger!' And that ended that.</p>

<p>"Speaking seriously, though," he went on, "the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>Americans who have
been attached to us are good stuff&mdash;keen to learn, and the right age
and stamp. When they pick up more old-soldier cunning, they'll be
mighty good."</p>

<p>"From all we hear, you fellows will teach them that," answered our
colonel. "I'm told that your infantry do practically what they like
with the Boche on their sector over the river. What was that story a
Corps officer told me the other day? Oh, I know! They say your
infantry send out patrols each day to find out how the Boche is
getting on with his new trenches. When he has dug well down and is
making himself comfortable, one of the patrol party reports, 'I think
it's deep enough now, sir'; and there is a raid, and the Australians
make themselves at home in the trench the Boche has sweated to make."</p>

<p>The Australian colonel nodded with pleasure. "Yes, our lot are pretty
good at the cuckoo game," he agreed.</p>

<p>Next morning our shaving operations were enlivened by the swift rush
of three high-velocity shells that seemed to singe the roof of the hut
I was in. They scattered mud, and made holes in the road below. "The
nasty fellow!" ejaculated our new American doctor, hastening outside,
with the active curiosity of the new arrival who has been little under
shell fire, to see where the shells had burst. Our little Philadelphia
medico had gone, a week before, to join the American forces. His
successor was broad-built, choleric, but kind of heart, and came from
Ohio. I suspected the new doctor of a sense of humour, as well as of
an understanding of current smart-set satire. "They kept me at your
base two months," he told me, "but I wanted to see the war. I also
heard an English doctor say he would be glad of a move, as the base
was full of P.U.O. and O.B.E.'s."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>After breakfast the colonel and myself passed through the battered
relics of Heilly on our way to the batteries. The rain and the
tremendous traffic of the previous night had churned the streets into
slush, but the feeling that we were on the eve of great events made me
look more towards things of cheer. The sign-board, "&mdash;th Division Rest
House," on a tumble-down dwelling ringed round with shell-holes,
seemed over-optimistic, but the intention was good. At the little
railway station a couple of straw-stuffed dummies, side by side on a
platform seat as if waiting for a train, showed that a waggish spirit
was abroad. One figure was made up with a black swallow-tailed coat,
blue trousers, and a bowler hat set at a jaunty angle; the other with
a woman's summer skirt and blouse and an open parasol. B Battery, who
had discovered excellent dug-outs in the railway cutting, reported
that their only trouble was the flies, which were illimitable. A and C
had their own particular note of satisfaction. They were sharing a row
of dug-outs equipped with German wire beds, tables, mirrors, and other
home comforts. "We adopted the Solomon method of division," explained
Major Bullivant. "I picked out two lots of quarters, and then gave C
first choice."</p>

<p>"We've got to select positions still farther forward for the batteries
to move to if the attack proves a success," said the colonel next day;
and on that morning's outing we walked a long way up to the infantry
outposts. We struck a hard main road that led due east across a wide
unwooded stretch of country. A drizzling rain had set in; a few big
shells grunted and wheezed high over our heads; at intervals we passed
litters of dead horses, rotting and stinking, and blown up like
balloons. At a cross-road we came to a quarry where a number of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>sappers were working. The captain in charge smiled when the colonel
asked what was the task in hand. "General &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; hopes it will become
his headquarters three hours after zero hour, sir."</p>

<p>"That ammunition's well hidden," remarked the colonel as we followed a
lane to the right, and noted some neat heaps of 18-pdr. shells tucked
under a hedge. We found other small dumps of ammunition hidden among
the corn, and stowed in roadside recesses. Studying his map, the
colonel led the way across some disused trenches, past a lonely
burial-place horribly torn and bespattered by shell fire, and up a
wide desolate rise. "This will do very well," said the colonel,
marking his map. He looked up at the grey sky and the heavy drifting
clouds, and added, "We'll be getting back."</p>

<p>We came back along the main road, meeting occasional small parties of
infantry, and turned to the right down a road that led to the nearest
village. A Boche 5&middot;9 was firing. The shells fell at minute intervals
four hundred yards beyond the road on which we were walking. The
colonel was describing to me some of the enjoyments of peace
soldiering in India, when there came a violent rushing of air, and a
vicious crack, and a shower of earth descended upon us; and dust hung
in the air like a giant shroud. A shell had fallen on the road forty
yards in front of us.</p>

<p>We had both ducked; the colonel looked up and asked, "Well, do we
continue?"</p>

<p>"We might get off the road and go round in a semi-circle, sir," I
hazarded. "I think it would be safer moving towards the gun than away
from it."</p>

<p>"No, I think that was a round badly 'layed,'" said the colonel. "We'll
keep on the road. Besides, we shall have time to get past before the
next one comes. But I <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>give you warning," he added with a twinkle,
"the next one that comes so near I lie down flat."</p>

<p>"I shall do exactly as you do, sir," I responded in the same spirit.</p>

<p>The colonel was right as usual. The next round went well over the road
again, and we walked along comfortably. At the entrance to the village
lay two horses, freshly killed. The harness had not been removed. The
colonel called to two R.A.M.C. men standing near. "Remove those
saddles and the harness," he said, "and place them where they can be
salvaged. It will mean cutting the girths when the horses commence to
swell."</p>

<p>At 4.30 next morning the batteries were roused to answer an S.O.S.
call. The rumble of guns along the whole of our Divisional front
lasted for two hours. By lunch-time we learned that strong Hun forces
had got into our trenches and penetrated as far as the quarry where
the colonel and myself had seen the sappers at work. Twenty sappers
and their officer had been caught below ground, in what had been
destined to become General &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;'s headquarters. Our counter-attack had
won back only part of the lost ground.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid they'll spot all that ammunition. They are almost certain
now to know that something's afoot," said the colonel thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Something like this always does happen when we arrange anything,"
broke in the adjutant gloomily.</p>

<p>There were blank faces that day. We waited to hear whether there would
be a change of plan. But after dark the ammunition waggons again
poured ceaselessly along the roads that led to the front.</p>

<h3>VI. THE BATTLE OF AUGUST 8<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>On the afternoon of August 7 the colonel left us to assume command of
the Divisional Artillery, the C.R.A. having fallen ill and the senior
colonel being on leave. Major Veasey, a Territorial officer, who was
senior to our two regular battery commanders, a sound soldier and a
well-liked man, had come over from D Battery to command the Brigade. A
determined counter-attack, carried out by one of our Divisional
infantry brigades, had won back most of the ground lost to the Boche
the day before. Operation orders for the big attack on the morning of
the 8th had been circulated to the batteries, and between 9
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> and 10 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> the guns were to move up to the
battle positions. The old wheeler was looking ruefully at the
ninety-two steps leading from the quarry up to our mess. Made of
wooden pegs and sides of ammunition boxes, the steps had taken him
three days to complete. "My gosh! that does seem a waste of labour,"
commented the American doctor, with a slow smile.</p>

<p>"Doctor, those steps will be a godsend to the next people who come to
live here," I explained. "That's one of the ways in which life is made
possible out here."</p>

<p>We dined at eight, and it was arranged that Major Veasey, the
adjutant, and the signalling officer should go on ahead, leaving me to
keep in telephone touch with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>batteries and Divisional Artillery until
communications were complete at the new headquarters.</p>

<p>Down below the regimental sergeant-major was loading up the G.S.
waggon and the Maltese cart. An ejaculation from Wilde, the signalling
officer, caused every one to stare through the mess door. "Why,
they're putting a bed on, ... and look at the size of it.... Hi! you
can't take that," he called out to the party below.</p>

<p>The doctor rose from his seat and looked down. "Why, that's <i>my</i> bed,"
he said.</p>

<p>"But, doctor, you can't take a thing like that," interposed the
adjutant.</p>

<p>The doctor's face flushed. This being his baptismal experience of the
Front, he regarded the broad wire bed he had found in his hut as a
prize; he seemed unaware that in this part of the world similar beds
could be counted in hundreds.</p>

<p>"But I like that bed. I can sleep on it. I want it, and mean to have
it," he went on warmly.</p>

<p>"Sorry, doctor," answered the adjutant firmly. "Our carts have as much
as they can carry already."</p>

<p>The doctor seemed disposed to have the matter out; but Major Veasey,
who had been regarding him fixedly, and looked amused, stopped further
argument by saying, "Don't worry, doctor. There are plenty of beds at
the new position."</p>

<p>The doctor sat down silent but troubled, and when the others went he
said he would stay behind with me. I think he wanted my sympathy, but
the telephone kept me so busy&mdash;messages that certain batteries had
started to move, demands from the staff captain for a final return
showing the shortage of gas-shell gauntlets, and for lists of area
stores that we expected to hand over, and a request from the adjutant
to bring the barometer that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>he had overlooked&mdash;that there was little
time for talk.</p>

<p>It was half-past ten when word having come that full communication had
been established at the new position, I told the two signallers who
had remained with me to disconnect the wires; and the doctor and I set
off. It was a murky night, and the air was warmly moist. The familiar
rumble of guns doing night-firing sounded all along the Front; enemy
shells were falling in the village towards which we were walking.
There was a short cut across the river and the railway and then on
through corn-fields. To strike it we ought to pass through a
particular skeleton house in the village we were leaving, out by the
back garden, and thence along a narrow track that led across a swamp.
In the dark I failed to find the house; so we plodded on, past the
church, and took to a main road. After walking two kilometres we
switched south along a by-road that led to the position A Battery had
occupied. Not a soul had passed since we took to the main road; the
Boche shells, now arriving in greater numbers, seemed, as is always
the case at night, nearer than they actually were.</p>

<p>Sounds of horses and of orders sharply given! It was the last section
of A Battery pulling out; in command young Stenson, a round-faced,
newly-joined officer, alert and eager, and not ill-pleased with the
responsibility placed upon him. "Have the other sections got up all
right?" I asked him. "Yes," he answered, "although they were shelled
just before getting in and Bannister was wounded&mdash;hit in the face, not
seriously, I think." Bannister, poor fellow, died three days later.</p>

<p>The doctor and I passed on, following a shell-plastered road that
wound towards a rough wooden bridge, put up a week before; thence
across soggy ground and over the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>railway crossing. There was a slight
smell of gas, and without a word to each other we placed our
box-respirators in the alert position. To avoid the passage of a
column of ammunition waggons crunching along one of the narrow streets
we stepped inside a crumbling house. No sign of furniture, no stove,
but in one corner&mdash;quaint relic of less eventful days&mdash;a
sewing-machine, not even rusted.</p>

<p>A grove of poplars embowered the quarry that we were seeking; and soon
our steps were guided by the neighing of horses, and by the raised
voice of the R.S.M. hectoring his drivers. The doctor and I were to
share a smelly dug-out, in which all the flies in the world seemed to
have congregated. The doctor examined at length the Boche wire bed
allotted to him, and refused to admit that it was as comfortable as
the one left behind. However, he expressed satisfaction with the
mahogany side-board that some previous occupant had loaned from a
neighbouring house; our servants had bespread it with newspapers and
made a washing-table of it.</p>

<p>The doctor quickly settled himself to sleep, but there were tasks for
me. "This is where I'm the nasty man," exclaimed Major Veasey,
descending the dug-out with a signalling watch in his hand. "I'm
afraid I shall have to ask you to take the time round to the batteries
and to the &nbsp;&mdash;th Brigade, who aren't in communication yet with
Divisional Artillery. Sorry to fire you out in the dark&mdash;but secrecy,
you know."</p>

<p>Zero hour was timed for 4.20 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>; it was now 11.30
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>; so I donned steel helmet and box-respirator, and was
moving off when a loud clear voice called from the road, "Is this &nbsp;&mdash;nd
Brigade Headquarters?" It was Major Simpson of B Battery, buoyant and
debonair. "Hallo!" he burst forth, noticing me. "Where are <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>you bound
for?... Um&mdash;yes!... I think I can save you part of the journey.... I'm
here, and Lamswell is coming along.... We're both going to the new
positions."</p>

<p>Captain Lamswell of C Battery suddenly appearing, accompanied by young
Beale of A Battery, we made our way to the mess, where Major Veasey
and the adjutant were sorting out alterations in the operation orders
just brought by a D.A. despatch-rider. Beale and Major Simpson
slaughtered a few dozen flies, and accepted whiskies-and-sodas. Then I
synchronised watches with representatives of the three batteries
present, and young Beale said that he would check the time with D
Battery, who were only two minutes' walk from A. That left me to call
upon the &nbsp;&mdash;th Brigade, who lay on the far side of the village three
parts of a mile out.</p>

<p>We set out, talking and jesting. There was a high expectancy in the
air that affected all of us. Major Simpson broke off humming "We are
the Robbers of the Wood" to say, "Well, if this show comes off
to-morrow, leave ought to start again." "I should shay sho," put in
Lamswell in his best Robey-cum-Billy Merson manner. "Doesn't interest
me much," said I. "I'm such a long way down the list that it will be
Christmas before I can hope to go. The colonel told me to put in for a
few days in Paris while we were out at rest last month, but I've heard
nothing more about it."</p>

<p>When Major Simpson, Lamswell, and Beale, with cheery "Good-night,"
made for the sunken road that led past the dressing station, and then
over the crest to their new positions, I kept on my way, leaving a
red-brick, barn-like factory on my left, and farther along a tiny
cemetery. Now that I was in open country and alone, I became more
keenly sensitive to the damp <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>mournfulness of the night. What if
to-morrow should result in failure? It was only four months since the
Hun was swamping us with his tempestuous might! Brooding menace seemed
in the air. A sudden burst of fire from four 5&middot;9's on to the
cross-roads I had just passed whipped my nerves into still greater
tension.</p>

<p>I strode on, bending my mind to the task in hand.</p>

<hr />

<p>At 4.40 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> I lifted my head to listen to the sound of the
opening barrage&mdash;a ceaseless crackle and rumble up in front. I had not
taken off my clothes, and quickly I ascended the dug-out steps. Five
hundred yards away a 60-pdr. battery belched forth noise and flame;
two 8-inch hows. on the far side of the road numbed the hearing and
made the earth tremble. A pleasant enough morning: the sun just
climbing above the shell-shattered, leaf-bare woods in front; the moon
dying palely on the other horizon; even a school of fast-wheeling
birds in the middle distance. Ten minutes, a quarter of an hour, half
an hour. Still no enemy shells in this support area. Could it be that
the attack had really surprised the Boche?</p>

<p>I turned into the adjutant's dug-out and found him lying down,
telephone to ear. "Enemy reply barrage only slight," he was repeating.</p>

<p>"Any news?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Some of the tanks missed their way," he answered. "A Battery have had
a gun knocked out and four men hit. No communication with any of the
other batteries."</p>

<p>By seven o'clock we were breakfasting, and Major Veasey announced his
intention of going forward to seek information. A grey clinging mist
had enveloped the countryside. "Something like March 21st," said the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>major as he and I set out. "We said it helped the Boche then. I hope
we don't have to use it as an excuse for any failure to-day. Difficult
for observers," he added thoughtfully.</p>

<p>At the dressing station in the sunken road we learned that one battery
of our companion Field Artillery Brigade had suffered severely from
gas. All the officers had been sent down, and a large proportion of
the gunners. The sickly-sweet smell hung faintly over most of the
ground in the neighbourhood of our batteries as well. A and C were now
firing fifty rounds an hour. "The major's asleep in that dug-out,"
volunteered Beale of A, pointing to a hole in a bank that allowed at
least two feet of air space above Major Bullivant's recumbent form.
The major was unshaven; his fair hair was tousled. He had turned up
the collar of his British warm. Beale also looked unkempt, but he said
he had had three hours' sleep before the barrage started and felt
quite fresh. "Our casualties came just after we got the guns in," he
told me. "They dropped two whizz-bangs between No. 1 gun and No. 2."</p>

<p>Major Simpson was up and eating hot sizzling bacon in a trench, with a
cable drum for a seat and an ammunition-box as table. Two of his
subalterns&mdash;Overbury, who won the M.C. on March 21st, and Bob
Pottinger, all smiles and appetite, at any rate this morning&mdash;had also
fallen to, and wanted Major Veasey and myself to drink tea. "We're
taking a short rest," remarked Major Simpson cheerfully. "I'm glad I
moved the battery away from the track over there. No shell has come
within three hundred yards of us.... We have had a difficulty about
the wires. Wilde said he laid wires from Brigade to all the new
positions before we came in last night, but my signallers haven't
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>found their wire yet; so we laid a line to A and got through that
way."</p>

<p>Infantry Brigade Headquarters was in a ravine four hundred yards away.
A batch of prisoners had just arrived and were being questioned by an
Intelligence officer: youngish men most of them, sallow-skinned, with
any arrogance they may have possessed knocked out of them by now. They
were the first Huns I remember seeing with steel helmets daubed with
staring colours by way of camouflage. "They say we were not expected
to attack to-day," I heard the Intelligence officer mention to the
G.S.O. II. of the Division, who had just come up.</p>

<p>"Is that one of your batteries?" asked the Infantry Brigade signalling
officer, an old friend of mine, pointing to our D Battery, a hundred
yards from Brigade Headquarters. "What a noise they made. We haven't
had a wink of sleep. How many thousand rounds have they fired?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it'll be about 1500 by midday, I expect," I answered. "Any news?"</p>

<p>"It's going all right now, I believe. Bit sticky at the start&mdash;my
communications have gone perfectly, so far&mdash;touch wood."</p>

<p>More prisoners kept coming in; limping, bandaged men passed on their
way down; infantry runners in khaki shorts, and motor-cycle
despatch-riders hurried up and buzzed around the Brigade Headquarters;
inside when the telephone bell wasn't ringing the brigade-major could
be heard demanding reports from battalions, or issuing fresh
instructions. There was so little fuss that numbers of quiet
self-contained men seemed to be standing about doing nothing.
Occasional high-velocity shells whizzed over our heads.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>Major Veasey suddenly emerged from the brigade-major's quarters,
looking at his map. "Some of the Tanks and two companies of the &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;s
lost their way at the start," he told me, "but things have been pulled
straight now. The &nbsp;&mdash;rd Brigade have gone right ahead. A hundred and
twenty prisoners up to date. Down south the Australians are on their
final objective. Yoicks!&mdash;this is the stuff to give 'em! Now we'll go
and have a look at my battery."</p>

<p>Captain Drysdale, who was commanding during Major Veasey's absence
from the 4&middot;5 battery, said that the programme had been carried through
without a hitch, although it had been difficult in the night to get
the hows. on to their aiming-posts without lights. "Kelly has gone
forward, and has got a message through. He says he saw some of our
firing, and the line was extraordinarily good."</p>

<p>"Good old Kelly!" said Major Veasey, puffing at his pipe. "I don't
know whether we shall be ordered to move forward to-day; we shan't
until the situation is thoroughly clear. But I shall go forward now
with Simpson and Bullivant to spy out the land. You'd better cut back
to Headquarters with what news we've got"&mdash;this was said to
me&mdash;"Division will be wanting something definite."</p>

<p>When about 3 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> Major Veasey returned, footsore and
wearied, he brought news that the Infantry Brigade that had reached
its final objective had had to come back, owing to the stoutness of
the machine-gun opposition. The attack would be renewed in the
morning, and the batteries would not move forward that evening.</p>

<p>The adjutant was opening the latest batch of official envelopes from
Divisional Artillery. With a laugh he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>flourished a yellow paper.
"Here's your leave to Paris," he called out.</p>

<p>"Certainly, I should take it," was Major Veasey's comment. "Why, I
knew one C.R.A. who never stopped officers' leave when they were in
action. It was only when the Division was at rest that he wouldn't let
them go. Said he wanted them for training then. You pop off."</p>

<p>And as this is a true tale, I hereby record that I did go to Paris,
and returned in full time to participate in the brave days that
witnessed Britain's greatest triumphs of the war.</p>

<h3>VII. SHORT LEAVE TO PARIS<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>Short leave to Paris ought to bequeath a main impression of swift
transition from the dirt, danger, and comfortlessness of the trenches
to broad pavements, shop windows, well-dressed women, smooth
courtliness, and restaurant luxuries; to fresh incisive talks on
politics and the Arts, to meetings with old friends and visits to
well-remembered haunts of the Paris one knew before August 1914.
Instead, the wearing discomforts of the journey are likely to retain
chief hold upon the memory. Can I ever forget how we waited seven
hours for a train due at 9.25 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> at a station that
possessed no forms to sit upon, so that some of the men lay at full
length and slept on the asphalt platform? And is there not a corner of
my memory for the crawling fusty leave-train that had bare planks
nailed across the door spaces of some of the "officers'" compartments;
a train so packed that we three officers took turns on the one spare
seat in an "other ranks" carriage? And then about 8 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> we
landed at a well-known "all-change" siding, a spot of such vivid
recollections that some one had pencilled in the ablution-house, "If
the Huns ever take &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; Camp and have to hold it they'll give up the
war in disgust."</p>

<p>But in the queue of officers waiting at the Y.M.C.A. hut for tea and
boiled eggs was the brigade-major of a celebrated Divisional
Artillery. He stood in front of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>me looking bored and dejected. I
happened to pass him a cup of tea. As he thanked me he asked, "Aren't
you fed up with this journey? Let's see the R.T.O. and inquire about a
civilian train!" "If you'll take me under your wing, sir," I responded
quickly. So we entered Paris by a fast train,&mdash;as did my two
companions of the night before, who had followed my tip of doing what
I did without letting outsiders see that there was collusion.</p>

<p>The brigade-major's wife was awaiting him in Paris, and I dined with
them at the Ritz and took them to lunch next day at Henry's, where the
frogs' legs were delicious and the chicken a recompense for that
night-mare of a train journey. Viel's was another restaurant which
retained a proper touch of the Paris before the war&mdash;perfect cooking,
courtly waiting, and prices not too high. I have pleasant
recollections also of Fouquet's in the Champs Elys&eacute;es, and of an
almost divine meal at the Tour d'Argent, on the other side of the
river, where Frederic of the Ibsen whiskers used once to reign: the
delicacy of the <i>souffl&eacute;e</i> of turbot! the succulent tenderness of the
<i>caneton &agrave; la presse</i>! the seductive flavour of the raspberries and
whipped cream!</p>

<p>The French Government apparently realise that the famous restaurants
of Paris are a national asset. There was no shortage of waiters; and,
though the choice of dishes was much more limited than it used to be,
the real curtailment extended only to cheese, sugar, and butter. Our
bread-tickets brought us as much bread as we could reasonably expect.</p>

<p>One day, in the Rue de la Paix, I met a well-known English producer of
plays, and he piloted me to the Caf&eacute; de Paris, which seemed to have
lost nothing of its special atmosphere of smartness and costliness.
Louis <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>the Rotund, who in the early days of the war went off to guard
bridges and gasometers, was playing his more accustomed r&ocirc;le of
<i>ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel</i>, explaining with suave gravity the unpreventable
altitude of prices. And for at least the tenth time he told me how in
his young-man soldiering days he came upon the spring whose waters
have since become world-famous.</p>

<p>Another night I ascended Montmartre, and dined under the volatile
guidance of Paul, who used to be a pillar of the Abbaye Th&eacute;l&egrave;me. Paul
came once to London, in the halcyon days of the Four Hundred Club,
when nothing disturbed him more than open windows and doors. "Keep the
guests dancing and the windows tight-closed, and you sell your
champagne," was his business motto. However, he was pleased to see me
again, and insisted on showing me his own particular way of serving
Cantelupe melon. Before scooping out each mouthful you inserted the
prongs of your fork into a lemon, and this lent the slightest of lemon
flavouring to the luscious sweetness of the melon.</p>

<p>America seemed to be in full possession of the restaurant and
boulevard life of Paris during those August days. Young American
officers, with plenty of money to spend, were everywhere. "You see," a
Parisienne explained, "before the war the Americans we had seen had
been mostly rich, middle-aged, business men. But when the American
officers came, Paris found that they were many, that many of them were
young as well as well-off, and that many of them were well-off, young,
and good-looking. It is quite <i>chic</i> to lunch or dine with an American
officer."</p>

<p>The Americans carried out their propaganda in their usual thorough,
enthusiastic fashion. I was taken to the Elys&eacute;e Palace Hotel, where I
found experienced publicists and numbers of charming well-bred women
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>busy preparing information for the newspapers, and arranging public
entertainments and sight-seeing tours for American troops in Paris,
all with the idea of emphasising that Americans were now pouring into
France in thousands. One night a smiling grey-haired lady stopped
before a table where four of us, all British officers, were dining,
and said, "You're English, aren't you? Well, have you been with any of
'our boys'?... Have you seen them in action?... They're fine, aren't
they?" We were surprised, a little taken aback at first, but we showed
sympathetic understanding of the American lady's enthusiasm, and
responded in a manner that left her pleased as ever.</p>

<p>Before returning to the Front I got in a day's golf at La Boulie, and
also made a train journey to a village the other side of
Fontainebleau, where an old friend, invalided from the French army,
had settled on a considerable estate, and thought of nothing but the
fruits and vegetables and dairy produce he was striving to improve and
increase. I did not visit many theatres; it struck me that the Paris
stage, like that of London, was undergoing a war
phase&mdash;unsophisticated, ready-to-be-pleased audiences bringing
prosperity to very mediocre plays.</p>

<hr />

<p>My journey back to the line included a stay at a depot where officers
were speedily reminded that they had left the smooth luxuriousness of
Paris behind them. The mess regulations opened with "Try to treat the
mess as a mess and not as a public-house," and contained such
additional instructions as, "Do not place glasses on the floor," and
"Officers will always see that they are in possession of sufficient
cash to pay mess bills."</p>

<p>I found the brigade three and a half miles in advance <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>of where I had
left them. There had been a lot of stiff fighting, and on our front
the British forces had not gone so far forward as the corps
immediately south of us had done. Big things were afoot, however, and
that very night batteries and Brigade Headquarters moved up another
three thousand yards. A snack of bully beef and bread and cheese at 7
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>, and the colonel and a monocled Irish major, who was
working under the colonel as "learner" for command of a brigade, went
off to see the batteries. The adjutant and myself, bound for the new
Headquarters, followed ten minutes later.</p>

<p>"You know that poor old Lamswell has gone," he said, as we crossed a
grassy stretch, taking a ruined aerodrome as our guiding mark. "Poor
chap, he was wounded at the battery position the day after you left.
Only a slight wound in the leg from a gas-shell, and every one thought
he had got a comfortable 'Blighty.' But gangrene set in, and he was
dead in three days. Beastly things those gas-shells!... Kent, too, got
one through the shoulder from a sniper, and he's gone to England. The
colonel was with him at the O.P., and tried to get the sniper
afterwards with a rifle."</p>

<p>"How is the colonel?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's going very strong; active as ever. Colonel &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; is back from
leave and doing C.R.A. now. We're under the &nbsp;&mdash;th Division at the
moment."</p>

<p>"You remember Colonel &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; who got the V.C. in the Retreat," he went
on; "he was killed on August 8th&mdash;went out to clear up a machine-gun
pocket.... Damned nice fellow, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>We reached a narrow road, crowded with battery ammunition waggons
going up to the new positions. Darkness had descended, and when you
got off the road <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>to avoid returning vehicles it was necessary to walk
warily to escape tumbling into shell-holes. "The blighters have got a
new way of worrying us now," went on the adjutant. "They've planted
land-mines all over the place, particularly near tracks. Lead-horses
are always liable to put a foot against the wire that connects with
the mine, and when the thing goes off some one is nearly always hurt.
D Battery had a nasty experience this afternoon. Kelly tried to take a
section forward, and the Boche spotted them and shelled them to
blazes. As they came back to get away from observation one of the
teams disturbed a land-mine. The limber was blown up, and one driver
and two horses were killed.... Look here, if we move off in this
direction we ought to save time; the railway must be over there and
the place for our Headquarters is not far from it, in a trench where
the O.P. used to be."</p>

<p>We found ourselves on some shell-torn ground that was cut up also by
short spans of trenches. One part of it looked exactly like another,
and after ten minutes or so we decided that we were wandering to no
purpose. "There are some old German gun-pits close by," panted the
adjutant in further explanation of the place we were seeking. All at
once I saw a thin shaft of light, and blundered my way towards it. It
proved to be a battery mess, made in a recess of a trench, with a
stout tarpaulin drawn tight over the entrance. I hailed the occupants
through the tarpaulin, and on their invitation scrambled a passage
inside. A young captain and two subalterns listened to what I had to
say, and gave me map co-ordinates of the spot on which we now were.
When I mentioned German gun-pits the captain responded with more
helpful suggestions. "It's difficult finding your way across country,
because the trenches <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>wind about so, but follow this trench as it
curves to the right, and when you come to an old British dug-out blown
right in, go due north across country; then you'll come to the
railway," he said.</p>

<p>We thanked him, plodded on, reached a point on the railway quite half
a mile beyond the spot we wanted, and then out of the darkness heard
the voice of Henry of C Battery. We drew near, and found him in the
mood of a man ready to fight the whole world. "Dam fools," he
grumbled: "there's a sergeant of A Battery who's taken a wrong turning
and gone into the blue, and half a dozen of my waggons have followed
him.... And B Battery have a waggon tipped over on the railway line,
just where we all cross, and that's holding everything else up."</p>

<p>As we could be of no assistance to the distressful Henry we continued
our own search, and, by hailing all within call, eventually reached
our trench, where we found the colonel, always in good mood when
something practical wanted doing, superintending Headquarters'
occupation of the place. "Major Mallaby-Kelby, the doctor, the
adjutant, and myself can fix up under here," he said, pointing to a
large tarpaulin fastened across the trench. "The signallers have got
the mined dug-out round the corner, and you," he went on, referring to
me, "had better start fixing Wilde and yourself up. We'll make that
gun-pit with the camouflaged roofing into a mess to-morrow."</p>

<p>With the aid of the servants I gathered six long two-inch planks, and
placed them across the part of the trench that seemed best protected
from enemy shells. A spare trench cover pulled full stretch on top of
these planks lent additional immunity from rain. A little shovelling
to level the bottom of the trench, and Wilde's <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>servant and mine laid
out our valises. A heap of German wicker ammunition-carriers, sorted
out on the ground, served as a rough kind of mattress for the colonel.
The doctor had fastened upon a spare stretcher. In half an hour we
were all seeking sleep.</p>

<p>Zero hour was at 1 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>, a most unusual time for the infantry
to launch an attack. But this would increase the element of surprise,
and the state of the moon favoured the enterprise. When hundreds of
guns started their thunder I got up to see, and found the doctor on
the top of the trench also. Bursts of flame leapt up all around, and
for miles to right and left of us. The noise was deafening. When one
has viewed scores of modern artillery barrages one's impressions
become routine impressions, so to speak; but the night, and the
hundreds and hundreds of vivid jumping flashes, made this 1
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> barrage seem the most tremendous, most violently
terrible of my experience. The doctor, looking a bit chilled, gazed
long and solemnly at the spectacle, and for once his national gift of
expressing his feelings failed him.</p>

<p>When news of the results of the operation came to us it was of a
surprising character. The infantry had moved forward under cover of
the barrage, had reached their first objective, and continued their
advance two miles without encountering opposition. The Boche had
stolen away before our guns loosed off their fury. I only saw three
prisoners brought in, and some one tried to calculate the thousands of
pounds worth of ammunition wasted on the "barrage." A message came
that we were to hold ourselves in readiness to rejoin our own
Divisional Artillery; our companion Field Artillery Brigade, the &nbsp;&mdash;rd,
would march also. At 6.30 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> the orders arrived. We were to
trek northwards, about <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>four thousand yards as the crow flies, and be
in touch with our C.R.A. early next morning.</p>

<p>That night rain fell in torrents. When we had dined, and all the kit
had been packed up, we sheltered in the gun-pit, awaiting our horses
and the baggage-waggons. As the rain found fresh ways of coming
through the leaky roof, we shifted the boxes on which we sat; all of
us except the colonel, who, allowing his chin to sink upon his breast,
slept peacefully for three-quarters of an hour. It was pitch-dark
outside, and the trench had become a glissade of slimy mud. It was
certain that the drivers would miss their way, and two of the
signallers who had gone out to guide them along the greasy track from
the railway crossing had come back after an hour's wait. After a time
we ceased trying to stem the rivulets that poured into the gun-pit; we
ceased talking also, and gave ourselves up to settled gloom, all
except the colonel, who had picked upon the one dry spot and still
slept.</p>

<p>But things mostly come right in the end. The rain stopped, a misty
moon appeared; the vehicles came along, and by 10.30 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> the
colonel was on his mare, picking a way for our little column around
shell-holes, across water-logged country, until we struck a track
leading direct to Meaulte, where the Brigade had been billeted during
1915. It was a strangely silent march. There was a rumbling of guns a
long way to north of us, and that was all. The Boche had undoubtedly
stolen away. For a long time the only sound was the warning shout,
passed from front to rear, that told of shell-holes in the roadway.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of the village we saw signs of the Hun evacuation:
deserted huts and stables, a couple of abandoned motor-lorries. The
village itself was a wreck, a dust-heap, not a wall left whole after
our terrific <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>bombardments. Not a soul in the streets, not a single
house habitable even for troops. Of the mill that had been Brigade
Headquarters three years before, one tiny fragment of a red-brick wall
was left. The bridge in front of it had been scattered to the winds;
and such deep shell-craters pitted the ground and received the running
water, that the very river-bed had dried up. On the other side of the
village batteries of our own and of our companion brigade moved slowly
along. It was 2 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> when we encamped in a wide meadow off
the road. When the horses had been tethered and fed and the men had
erected their bivouacs, the colonel, Major Mallaby-Kelby, and we five
remaining officers turned into one tent, pulled off boots and
leggings, and slept the heavy dreamless sleep of healthily tired men.</p>

<p>At 7 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> the colonel announced that he and myself would ride
up to B&eacute;court Chateau to visit the C.R.A. We touched the southern edge
of Albert, familiar to thousands of British soldiers. The last time I
had been there was on my return from leave in January 1917, when I
dined and slept at the newly-opened officers' club. Since the Boche
swoop last March it had become a target for British gunners, and
seemed in as bad a plight as the village we had come through the night
before. We had no time to visit it that morning, and trotted on along
a road lined with unburied German dead, scattered ammunition, and
broken German vehicles. The road dipped into a wood, and the colonel
showed me the first battery position he occupied in France, when he
commanded a 4&middot;5 how. battery. B&eacute;court Chateau was so much a chateau
now that Divisional Headquarters were living in tents outside. Four
motor-cars stood in the courtyard; some thirty chargers were tied to
the long high railings; motor despatch-riders kept coming <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>and going.
R.A. were on the far side of the chateau, and when our grooms had
taken our horses we leapt a couple of trenches and made our way to the
brigade-major's tent. The brigade-major was frankly pleased with the
situation. "We are going right over the old ground, sir," he told the
colonel, "and the Boche has not yet made a proper stand. Our
Divisional Infantry are in the line again, and the latest report,
timed 6 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>, comes from Montauban, and says that they are
approaching Trones Wood. We shall be supporting them to-morrow
morning, and the C.R.A. is anxious for positions to be reconnoitred in
X 10 and X 11. The C.R.A. has gone up that way in the car this
morning."</p>

<p>I looked into an adjoining tent and found the liaison officer from the
heavies busy on the telephone. "A 5&middot;9 battery shooting from the
direction of Ginchy. Right! You can't give me a more definite
map-spotting? Right-o! We'll attend to it! Give me counter-batteries,
will you?"</p>

<p>"Heavies doing good work to-day?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Rather," he returned happily. "Why, we've got a couple of 8-inch
hows. as far up as Fricourt. That's more forward than most of the
field-guns."</p>

<p>As I stepped out there came the swift screaming rush of three
high-velocity shells. They exploded with an echoing crash in the wood
below, near where my horse and the colonel's had been taken to water.
A team came up the incline toward the chateau at the trot, and I
looked rather anxiously for our grooms. They rode up within two
minutes, collectedly, but each with a strained look. "Did those come
anywhere near you?" I inquired. "We just missed 'em, sir," replied
Laneridge. "One of them dropped right among the horses at one
trough."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>By the colonel's orders I rode back to the waggon lines soon
afterwards, bearing instructions to the battery commanders to join the
colonel at half-past one. The Brigade might expect to move up that
evening.</p>

<p>The battery commanders came back by tea-time with plans for that
evening's move-up completed. The waggon lines during the afternoon
were full of sleeping gunners; a sensible course, as it proved, for at
6.45 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> an orderly brought the adjutant a pencilled message
from the colonel who was still with the C.R.A. It ran&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>Warn batteries that they must have gun limbers and firing
battery waggons within 1000 yards of their positions by 3.30
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>, as we shall probably move at dawn. Headquarters
will be ready to start after an early dinner. I am returning by
car.</p></div>

<p>"Hallo! they're expecting a big advance to-morrow," said the adjutant.
The note also decided a discussion in which the adjutant, the
signalling officer, and the cook had joined as to whether we should
dine early and pack up ready to go, or pack up and have dinner when we
got to the new position behind Mametz Wood.</p>

<p>It was a dark night again; other brigades of artillery were taking the
same route as ourselves, and, apart from the congestion, our own guns
had shelled this part so consistently since August 8 that the going
was heavy and hazardous. We passed one team with two horses down; at
another point an 18-pdr. had slipped into a shell-hole, and the air
rang with staccato shouts of "Heave!" while two lines of men strained
on the drag-ropes. We reached a damp valley that lay west of a stretch
of tree-stumps and scrubby undergrowth&mdash;remnants of what was a thick
leafy wood before the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>hurricane bombardments of July 1916. D Battery
had pulled their six hows. into the valley; the three 18-pdr.
batteries were taking up positions on top of the eastern slope. Before
long it became clear that the Boche 5&middot;9 gunners had marked the place
down.</p>

<p>"I'm going farther along to X 30 <span class="sc">A</span>, and shall stay with the
Infantry brigadier," the colonel told me in his quick incisive way.
"Major Mallaby-Kelby and the adjutant will come with me. You will stay
here with Wilde, and pass orders from us to the batteries. There are
some Boche huts in that bank, and I picked one for you this
afternoon."</p>

<p>There was indeed a row of beautifully made wooden huts, quite new,
covered with waterproof felt, lined with match-boarding, and fitted
with cupboards and comfort-bringing devices. The Boche has no scruples
about cutting down trees in an enemy country for material for his
dwelling-places, but he also seems to possess an unlimited number of
workmen, who lavish skill and care in making them pleasant to live in.
Major Veasey had taken possession of a truly palatial hut for his
mess. "Our infantry only got here to-day," he said, "and they captured
some of the men who were adding the finishing touches." Major Simpson
and Major Bartlett had set up a joint mess, and there was an ample
supply of wire beds. Major Bullivant's officers were housed three
hundred yards away.</p>

<p>Wilde came in full of a dispute he had had with Dumble as to whether
Headquarter signallers or A Battery's servants should occupy a certain
dug-out with a corrugated-iron roof. "Dumble said he was there first,
and claimed it on that ground," said Wilde, "but I told him the
colonel had said I could have it, and that concluded the
entertainment."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>We had left "Swiffy," the veterinary officer, at the waggon line, but
the doctor had accompanied us, and he was first to curl himself up on
his stretcher. Wilde and I posted ourselves on a couple of raised wire
beds.</p>

<p>The adjutant always said that the doctor was able to snore in five
different keys. He started off that night with a series of
reverberating blasts that caused Wilde to laugh hysterically and call
out, "For Heaven's sake, doc., be quiet, or you'll give the position
away to the Boche." But the doctor didn't hear the appeal; nor did he
wake up when three high-velocity shells landed a hundred yards away on
the hill behind us. The huts were, of course, on the wrong side of the
valley from our point of view of Boche shelling, and many more shells
whizzed shrilly over our heads before the night was out.</p>

<p>Half an hour after we had fallen asleep an orderly woke me with a
"secret" communication that gave 4.50 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> as zero hour, and
I circulated the news to the batteries. Some time later the telephone
bell aroused me, and the adjutant said he wanted to give me the time.
Some one had knocked over my stub of candle, and after vainly groping
for it on the floor, I kicked Wilde, and succeeded in making him
understand that if he would light a candle and check his watch, I
would hang on to the telephone. Dazed with sleep, Wilde clambered to
his feet, trod once or twice on the doctor, and lighted a candle.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" asked the voice at the other end of the telephone.
"Ready, Wilde?" said I in my turn.</p>

<p>"I'll give it you when it's four minutes to one ... thirty seconds to
go," went on the adjutant.</p>

<p>Now Wilde always says that the first thing he heard was my calling
"thirty seconds to go!" and that I did <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>not give him the "four minutes
to one" part of the ceremony. I always tell him he must have been half
asleep, and didn't hear me. At any rate, the dialogue continued like
this&mdash;</p>

<p>Adjutant (over the telephone to me): "Twenty seconds to go."</p>

<p>Me (to Wilde): "Twenty seconds to go."</p>

<p>Wilde: "Twenty seconds."</p>

<p>Adjutant: "Ten seconds to go."</p>

<p>Me: "Ten seconds."</p>

<p>Wilde: "Ten seconds."</p>

<p>Adjutant: "Five seconds."</p>

<p>Me: "Five."</p>

<p>Wilde: "Five."</p>

<p>Adjutant: "Now! Four minutes to one."</p>

<p>Me: "NOW! Four minutes to one."</p>

<p>Wilde (blankly): "But you didn't tell me what time it was going to
be."</p>

<p>It was useless arguing, and I had to ring up the adjutant again. As a
matter of fact it was the colonel who answered, and supplied me with
the "five seconds to go" information; so there was no doubt about the
correctness of the time-taking on this occasion, and after I had gone
out and roused an officer of each battery, and made him check his
watch, I turned in again and sought sleep.</p>

<h3>VIII. TRONES WOOD AGAIN<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>For three hours after zero hour our guns spat fire, fining down from
four rounds a gun a minute to the slow rate of one round each minute.
The enemy artillery barked back furiously for the first two hours, but
got very few shells into our valley; and after a time we paid little
heed to the 5&middot;9's and 4&middot;2's that dropped persistently on the top of
the western slope. An 8-inch that had landed in the valley about
midnight had wrought frightful execution, however. Another brigade lay
next to us; in fact one of their batteries had occupied a position
intended for our C Battery. The shell fell with a blinding crash among
their horses, which they had kept near the guns in readiness for the
morning; and for half an hour the darkness was pierced by the cries
and groans of wounded men, and the sound of revolvers putting horses
out of their pain. Four drivers had been killed and twenty-nine horses
knocked out. "A lucky escape for us," was the grim, not unsympathetic
comment of C Battery.</p>

<p>All through the morning the messages telephoned to me indicated that
the fighting up forward had been hard and relentless. Our infantry had
advanced, but twice before eleven o'clock I had to dash out with
S.O.S. calls; and at intervals I turned each battery <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>on to enemy
points for which special artillery treatment was demanded.</p>

<p>The colonel ordered Wilde and myself to join the forward Headquarters
party after lunch. We found them in a small square hut, built at the
foot of a range of hills that rose almost sheer 200 feet up, and
curled round north-east to Catterpillar Valley in which our batteries
had spent a bitter punishing time during the third week of July 1916.
The hut contained four wire beds and a five-foot shaft in one corner,
where a solitary telephonist crouched uncomfortably at his task. The
hut was so cramped for space that one had to shift the table&mdash;a
map-board laid upon a couple of boxes&mdash;in order to move round it.</p>

<p>The winding road outside presented a moving war panorama that
afternoon. Two Infantry brigades and their staffs, and some of the
battalion commanders, had huts under the hillside, and by four o'clock
battalions returned from the battle were digging themselves sheltering
holes higher up the hillside. Boche prisoners in slow marching
twenties and thirties kept coming along also; some of them used as
stretcher-bearers to carry their own and our wounded; others were
turned on to the odd jobs that the Army call fatigues. I found one
long-haired, red-eyed fellow chopping wood for our cook; my appearance
caused a signaller, noted for his Hyde Park Corner method of oratory,
to cease abruptly a turgid denunciation of the Hun and all his works.</p>

<p>The talk was all of a counter-attack by which a battalion of Prussian
Guards had won back the eastern corner of Trones Wood, one of the
day's objectives. One of the Infantry brigadiers, a tall, tireless,
fighting soldier, who started the war as a captain, had come <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>round to
discuss with the colonel artillery support for the fresh attack his
Brigade were to make at 5.45 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> This brigadier was rather
apt to regard 18-pounders as machine-guns; and it was sometimes
instructive to note the cool good-humoured way in which the colonel
guided his enthusiasm into other channels. "You're giving me one
forward section of 18-pounders there," began the brigadier, marking
the map. "Now,"&mdash;placing a long lean forefinger on a point 150 yards
behind our most advanced infantry post,&mdash;"couldn't I have another
little fellow there?&mdash;that would tickle him up."</p>

<p>The colonel smiled through his glasses. "I don't think we should be
helping you more, sir, by doing that.... I can shoot on that point
with observed fire as well from where the batteries are as from up
there; and think of the difficulty of getting ammunition up."</p>

<p>"Right!" responded the General, and turned immediately to the subject
of the 4&middot;5 how. targets.</p>

<p>I went outside, and saw Judd at the head of the two guns of B Battery,
that were to be the forward section in the attack, going by at the
trot. As he passed he gave me an "I'm for it" grin. I knew that he was
trotting his teams because the corner of the valley was still under
enemy observation, and had been shelled all day. Bob Pottinger was
following in rear.</p>

<p>Five minutes after the two guns passed, the Boche began a hellish
strafe upon a battery that had perched itself under the crest of the
hill. A couple of hundred 5&middot;9's came over, and we had a view of rapid
awe-inspiring bursts, and of men rushing for cover. "Good shooting
that," remarked the colonel, who had come to the doorway.</p>

<p>The brigadier paid us another visit late that night. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>He was almost
boyish in his glee. "A perfect little show," he told the colonel.
"Your forward guns did very fine work indeed. And the 6-inch hows.
gave the wood an awful pasting. From the reports that have come in we
only took seven Boche prisoners; practically all the rest were
killed."</p>

<p>So we took our rest that night, content in the knowledge that things
were going well. There being only four beds, one of us would have to
doss down on the floor. The colonel insisted on coming into our "odd
man out" gamble. The bare boards fell to me; but I slept well. The
canvas bag containing my spare socks fitted perfectly into the hollow
of my hip&mdash;the chief recipe for securing comfort on hard ground.</p>

<p><i>R&eacute;veille</i> was provided by the bursting of an 8-inch shell on the
other side of the road. It removed part of the roof of our hut, and
smothered the rest with a ponderous shower of earth. We shaved and
washed by the roadside, and Major Mallaby-Kelby contrived a rapid and
complete change of underclothing, also in the open air.</p>

<p>By 8.30 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> the colonel, Major Mallaby-Kelby, and the
battery commanders were walking briskly through the valley and on to
the rolling country beyond, reconnoitring for positions to which the
batteries would move in the afternoon. Wilde and myself accompanied
them, and as Judd and Bob Pottinger were also of the party I heard
more details of what B Battery's forward section had done the evening
before.</p>

<p>"I saw you turn into the valley at the trot," I said to Judd.</p>

<p>"Yes, by Gad," he replied; "and when we got into the valley we made it
a canter. Those dead horses will show you what the valley has been
like."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>We were striding through the valley now&mdash;a death-trap passage, two
hundred yards across at its widest point, and less than three-quarters
of a mile long. I counted twenty-seven dead horses, lying in grotesque
attitudes, some of them cruelly mangled. The narrow-gauge railway had
become scattered bits of scrap-iron, the ground a churned waste of
shell-holes.</p>

<p>"And the worst of it was that the traces of the second team broke,"
Pottinger chimed in. "Judd had gone on ahead, and we hadn't any spare
traces. So I sent that team back out of the way, followed the first
gun, and brought the team back to take up the second gun. Damned good
team that, E sub-section. You remember the team we were training for
the 'Alarm Race' when we were out at St Saveur? That's the one.... And
the old Boche was peppering the valley all the time."</p>

<p>"Did the Boche shell much during the attack?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Well," continued Pottinger, "he gave the guns most of the shelling
&mdash;&mdash;. I was shooting the battery and Judd was doing F.O.O. with the
infantry,&mdash;and where Judd was it was mostly machine-guns."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Judd, "I got the wind-up with those machine-guns. I
couldn't find the battalion headquarters at first, and it was 150
yards from the wood. The first lot of machine-gun bullets went in
front of me; one plopped into a bank just past my foot. It was dam
funny. I spun right round.... But the infantry colonel, the colonel of
the &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;s, was a brave man. We only had a tiny dug-out, and every time
you got out the machine-gun started. But he didn't mind; he got out
and saw for himself everything that was going on. Didn't seem to worry
him at all.... And I shall never <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>forget the way the heavies lammed it
into the wood. They had half an hour, six batteries of 6-inch
howitzers, before the 18-pounders put in a five minutes' burst of
shrapnel.... They say the wood is choked with German dead."</p>

<p>It was this self-same colonel who wrote to his brigadier commending
the fine work of Judd and Pottinger on that day. Before October was
out each was wearing the M.C. ribbon.</p>

<p>Battery positions being selected, the colonel, Major Mallaby-Kelby,
and myself cast round for a headquarters. Some machine-gunners had
taken possession of the only possible dug-outs. However, there were
numerous huts, abandoned by the Hun, and I was chalking our claim on a
neat building with a latched door and glass windows, and a garden-seat
outside, when the colonel, who was gazing through his binoculars at
the long, dense, hillside wood that marked the eastern edge of the
valley, said in his decisive way, "What's that Swiss ch&acirc;let at the top
of the gully in the centre of wood?... Looks a proper sort of place
for headquarters!... Let's go and inspect it."</p>

<p>The view through the binoculars was not deceptive; indeed, when we
plunged into the wood and made the steep climb up to the ch&acirc;let, we
passed five or six beautifully built huts hidden among the trees. The
ch&acirc;let was equipped with a most attractive verandah; a hundred feet
below stood a larger wooden building, covered with black felt and
lined with match-boarding. The main room possessed tables obviously
made by expert carpenters, and a roomy bench, with a sloping back,
that went round two sides of the apartment. An inner bedroom contained
a wood-framed bed with a steel spring-mattress and a number of
plush-bottomed chairs. The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>Boche had extended his craftsmanship to
the neat slats that covered the joinings of the wall-planks and kept
out draughts. All the wood used was new and speckless, and smelt sweet
and clean. The other huts were constructed with similar attention to
detail. Also, one came across tables and benches in shady nooks, and
arbours of the kind found in German beer-gardens.</p>

<p>"Jehoshaphat," gasped Major Mallaby-Kelby, "this is indeed the height
of war luxury." The colonel, who was going on leave next day, not
having been in England since the early part of January, smiled in his
turn, and jested upon the desirability of delaying his departure until
we vacated this delightful retreat. Wilde and myself nosed about
joyously, chalking the name of our unit on every door within reach.
From a Boche artillery map picked up in the ch&acirc;let we concluded that
the place must have been the summer quarters of a Hun artillery group
commander.</p>

<p>And then without warning our satisfaction was changed to
disappointment. Major Mallaby-Kelby had just called out that the place
was so complete that even a funk-hole had been provided, when a gunner
emerged.</p>

<p>"What are you doing here?" inquired the major in surprise.</p>

<p>"I'm left here until our brigade headquarters come in, sir," the
gunner replied promptly.</p>

<p>"What brigade?"</p>

<p>"The &nbsp;&mdash;rd, sir," said the gunner, naming our companion Artillery
Brigade.</p>

<p>"When did Colonel &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; take over?" asked the colonel.</p>

<p>"About an hour ago, sir. He left me to look after the place until
Brigade Headquarters came in this afternoon."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>We looked solemnly at one another. "We've been forestalled," said the
colonel with mock despair. Then with brisk decision, "Well, there are
plenty more huts about here. We'll hurry up and get settled before
other people come along."</p>

<hr />

<p>The colonel left us during the afternoon. The C.R.A.'s car was to come
for him at headquarters waggon line early next morning. The doctor,
who was now living with the veterinary officer and the French
interpreter at the waggon line, had visited our new quarters in the
wood, and hoicked off our last but one bottle of whisky. I had
despatched a frantic S.O.S., coupled with 100 francs in cash, to the
colonel, begging him take the interpreter to Boulogne so as to
replenish our mess supplies. Our good friends of the &nbsp;&mdash;rd Brigade had
occupied the ch&acirc;let, and received one sharp reminder that the Boche
gunner was still a nasty animal. A high-velocity shell had hit the
edge of the gully not ten yards from them, and their adjutant and
their intelligence officer had described to me their acrobatic plunge
into the funk-hole. Major Mallaby-Kelby was commanding our Brigade in
the absence of the colonel, and already our signal-wires buzzed with
reports that indicated a very short sojourn in our new home in the
wood.</p>

<p>I am making this narrative a plain matter-of-fact record of incidents
and episodes in the career of our Brigade&mdash;which, let it be noted, was
in action from August 1, before the British advance commenced, until
November 4, the day of the final decisive thrust&mdash;because such an
account, however poorly told, offers a picture of real war: the war
that is by no means one continuous stretch of heroism and martyrdom
<i>in excelsis</i>, of guns galloping to death or glory, of bayonets
dripping <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>with enemy blood, of "our gallant lads" meeting danger and
destruction with "characteristic British humour and cheerfulness,"
when they are not "seeing red." On that 29th of August, when Major
Mallaby-Kelby assumed command, we knew that the campaign had taken a
definite turn in our favour, but none of us expected the Boche to be
so harried and battered that by November he would be suing for peace.
And I am stating bald unimaginative facts if I say that one of the
main aspirations among officers and men was to continue the advance in
such a way as to make sure of decent quarters o' nights, and to drive
the Germans so hard that when winter set in we should be clear of the
foul mud tracts and the rat-infested trenches that had formed the
battlefields of 1915, '16, and '17. Major Mallaby-Kelby was a keen
pushful officer, immensely eager to maintain the well-known efficiency
of the Brigade while the colonel was away; but he took me into his
confidence on another matter. "Look here!" he began, jocularly and
with a sweeping gesture. "I'm going to ask you to make sure that the
mess never runs out of white wine. It's most important. Unless I get
white wine my efficiency will be impaired." I replied with due
solemnity, and said that in this important matter our interpreter
should be specially commissioned to scour the countryside.</p>

<p>By 1 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> it became so certain that the enemy had inaugurated
a retreat that the major issued orders for the Brigade to move forward
three miles. We marched steadily down the valley through which Judd
and Pottinger had passed on their forward-section adventure, skirted
the wood that they had assisted the Divisional Infantry to recapture,
and halted for further instructions west of a deserted colony of
battered Nissen huts, gaping holes and broken bricks shovelled into
piles, still entered <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>on the maps as the village of Guillemont. It
would have been a truer description to paint on the sign-boards, "This
was Villers Carbonnel," as has been done at one desolate spot between
Peronne and Villers Bretonneux. Along the valley we had passed were
row after row of solidly-built stables left uncleaned and smelly by
the fleeing Hun; rotting horses smothered with flies; abandoned trucks
marooned on the few stretches of the narrow-gauge railway left whole
by our shell-fire. In the wood stood numerous Boche-built huts, most
of them put up since the March onslaught. The Boche, dirty cur that he
is, had deliberately fouled them before departing. The undulating
waste land east of Trones Wood, hallowed by memories of fierce battles
in 1916, had remained untroubled until the last few weeks; and the
hundreds of shell-holes, relics of 1916, had become grass-grown. The
hummocky greenness reminded one of nothing so much as a seaside
golf-course.</p>

<h3>IX. DOWN THE ROAD TO COMBLES<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>A Battery had been ordered to move about half a mile beyond
Guillemont, and to come into action off the road that led towards the
extensive, low-lying village of Combles, through which the enemy front
line now ran. Major Mallaby-Kelby had gone forward and the three
remaining batteries awaited his return.</p>

<p>I clambered my horse over the shell-holes and rubbish heaps of
Guillemont, a preliminary to a short reconnaissance of the roads and
tracks in the neighbourhood. Old Silvertail, having become a confirmed
wind-sucker, had been deported to the Mobile Veterinary Section;
Tommy, the shapely bay I was now riding, had been transferred to me by
our ex-adjutant, Castle, who had trained him to be well-mannered and
adaptable. "A handy little horse," was Castle's stock description,
until his increasing weight made Tommy too small for him. I had ridden
about six hundred yards past the sunken road in which A Battery's
ammunition waggons were waiting, when half a dozen 5&middot;9's crashed round
and about them. I turned back and saw more shells descend among the
empty Nissen huts in Guillemont. Two drivers of A Battery were being
carried away on stretchers and the waggons were coming towards me at a
trot. They halted four hundred yards from the spot where they had
been <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>shelled, and young Beale said they counted themselves lucky not
to have had more casualties.</p>

<p>The Boche by now had got his guns in position and began a two hours'
bombardment of Guillemont and its cross-roads. It was not until 7
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> that Major Mallaby-Kelby returned. He was tired, but
anxious to go forward. "We are the advanced Brigade for to-morrow's
show," he said. "The battery positions are only 1600 yards from the
Boche, but I think they will be comparatively safe.... I want you all
to come along and we'll arrange a headquarters. I've got my eye on a
sunken Nissen hut. There's a section commander of another brigade in
it, but it ought to be big enough to hold us as well."</p>

<p>So the major, the adjutant, Wilde, and myself walked at a smart pace
along the road to Combles. The Boche shells were mostly going over our
heads, but whizz-bangs now and again hit the ground to left and right
of us; a smashed limber had not been cleared from the road, and fifty
yards short of the railway crossing four decomposing horses emitted a
sickening stench. "We'll have our headquarters waggon line along there
first thing to-morrow," announced the major, stretching a long arm
towards a side-road with a four-foot bank.</p>

<p>At the forsaken railway halt we turned off the roadway and followed
the line, obeying to the letter the major's warning to bend low and
creep along under cover of the low embankment, "Now we'll slip through
here," said the major, after a six-hundred-yards' crawl. We hurried
through what had been an important German depot. There was one
tremendous dump of eight-gallon, basket-covered wine bottles&mdash;empty
naturally; a street of stables and dwelling-huts; a small mountain of
mouldy hay; and several vast barns that had been used for <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>storing
clothing and material. Each building was protected from our bombers by
rubble revetments, fashioned with the usual German carefulness. "They
shell here pretty consistently," added the major encouragingly, and we
made for more open land that sloped up towards a well-timbered wood on
the wide-stretched ridge, a thousand yards away. The sparse-covered
slopes were dotted with living huts, all built since the Boche
recovered the ground in his March push. "A Battery have moved to
within two hundred yards of Leuze Wood now&mdash;you can see the guns,"
resumed the major. "The other battery positions are on the southern
side of the road. The place I have in my eye for headquarters is close
to A Battery."</p>

<p>The German artillery had quite evidently understood the likelihood of
British batteries occupying the slope, and were acting accordingly.
Our party had reached a smashed hut three hundred yards from A
Battery, when the whine of an approaching shell caused us to drop to
ground; it fell fifty yards away, and the air became dense with flying
pieces of shell and earth showers. As we raised ourselves again we saw
Beadle walking at an even pace towards us. "Not a nice spot, sir," he
began, saluting the major. "We picked that place for a mess"&mdash;pointing
to the broken hut&mdash;"and five minutes later a shell crashed into it.
There's a dead horse round the corner ..."</p>

<p>"Have you been shelled much at the battery?" demanded the major.</p>

<p>"We had two sergeants killed a quarter of an hour ago, sir.... Captain
Dumble is arranging to shift the guns a bit north of the present
position,&mdash;do you approve of that, sir?"</p>

<p>"Yes, certainly," responded Major Mallaby-Kelby hastily. "If the
direction of the shelling indicates that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>it would mean more safety
for the battery I'm all for shifting." Beadle saluted and went away.</p>

<p>There was not as much spare room in the Nissen hut as the major had
thought. He asked me to "organise things" and to "scrounge round" for
a trench-cover to separate the subaltern and his gunners from our
party; but while I was dodging shells, making the search, he found a
small Boche combination hut and dug-out. The opening pointed the wrong
way, of course; but there was one tiny chamber twenty feet below
ground with a wooden bed in it, and upstairs a table, a cupboard, and
a large heap of shavings. It was now eight o'clock, and the major
remembered that he had not even had tea.</p>

<p>"Now what are we going to do about a meal?" he broke out. "We can't
have many servants up here, there's no room ... and it will be
difficult to get the mess cart up. Now, who has any suggestions? On
these matters I like to hear suggestions."</p>

<p>My own idea was that Meddings the cook, the major's servant, and one
other servant should bring up some bully-beef, cheese, and bread, and
bacon and tea for the morning. All that we wanted could be carried in
a couple of sandbags. We could do without valises and blankets that
night. Zero hour for the battle was 5.15 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> The mess cart
could come along afterwards. The proposition was favourably received,
the major's only revision referring to his white wine.</p>

<p>Headquarter waggons had remained the other side of Guillemont, and I
volunteered to walk back and bring the servants up. The major thought
that Wilde ought to accompany me; it was not too pleasant a pilgrimage
with the Boche maintaining his shelling.</p>

<p>But as we climbed the stairs of the dug-out the major made a further
decision. "I think you might as well <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>bring the mess cart," he called
out. I paused. "Not very easy to bring it round here in the dark,
sir," I said, and Wilde raised his eyebrows deprecatingly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think you had better bring it," continued the major. "There
are two officers, and besides, the drivers have to learn the way to
come here.... Don't forget my bottle of white wine, old fellow," was
his parting reminder as Wilde and I set off.</p>

<p>The nature of the shelling caused us to direct our steps through the
Boche depot towards the railway again. "Pity we didn't have something
to eat before we came up here," growled Wilde. "What road are we going
to bring the cart along when we come back? There's no proper track
when we get off the main road."</p>

<p>I looked back towards the hut in which we had left the major and the
adjutant. There was little to distinguish it from several other huts.
"There's the Red Cross station and that big wooden building at the
corner; I think we shall recognise them again," I said.</p>

<p>"Do you see that signalling pole on the roadside? That's a pole
crossing, and I know there's a track leading off the road there,"
added Wilde shrewdly. "That's the way we'd better bring the cart."</p>

<p>It was nearly dark when we reached the Guillemont cross-roads. Small
parties of infantrymen were coming along, and ammunition and ration
waggons. As we turned up the road leading south-west, a
square-shouldered man with a stiff big-peaked cap saluted with the
crisp correctness of the regular soldier. I recognised the
sergeant-major of A Battery.</p>

<p>"Were you much shelled when you took your waggon lines up there this
evening?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. It got too hot, and Major Bullivant sent <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>us down again
half an hour ago. All the batteries have shifted their waggon lines
back behind Guillemont, sir."</p>

<p>"All the more exciting for us," muttered Wilde. By the aid of my
electric torch we picked our way along a rough track that took us to
our waggons. The drivers and spare signallers were waiting orders to
settle down for the night. When I told the cook that we only wanted
bare necessities in the mess cart, he answered, "That'll mean emptying
the cart first. We've got everything aboard now." Such things as the
stove, the spare crockery and cutlery, several tins of biscuits, and
the officers' kit were quickly dumped upon the ground, and I told off
one of the servants to act as guard over it until the morning. "What
about this, sir?" inquired the cook, opening a large cardboard box.
"The interpreter sent it up this evening." I noted twenty eggs and a
cake. "Yes, put that in," I replied quickly.</p>

<p>Wilde detailed a signaller to accompany the driver of the cart, and,
with Meddings and two of the servants walking behind, the journey
commenced. A ten-minutes' hold-up occurred when Captain Denny of B
Battery, a string of waggons behind him, shouted my name through the
darkness. He wanted the loan of my torch for a brief study of the
shell-holes, as he intended establishing the battery waggon lines in
the vicinity.</p>

<p>The Boche had started his night-firing in earnest by the time the mess
cart and party passed the cross-roads at Guillemont. A pungent smell
of gas led to much coughing and sneezing. The air cleared as the road
ascended, but shells continued to fly about us, and no one looked
particularly happy. There were nervy, irritating moments when waggons
in front halted unaccountably; and, just before the railway crossing,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>Wilde had to go forward and coax a pair of R.E. mules, who refused to
pass the four dead horses lying in the road. The railway crossing
passed, we began to look for the black-and-white signalling pole.</p>

<p>"Here it is," called Wilde with relief, as a 5&middot;9 sped over us towards
the railway line. "Come along, Miller," he shouted to the mess-cart
driver, fifty yards behind us. The cart creaked and wobbled in the
bumpy ditch-crossing that led past the pole. "There's the big
building," said I, going on ahead, "and here's the Red Cross place.
We're getting on fine. We'll tell M'Klown and Tommy Tucker that we'll
apply for a job with the 980 company" (the A.S.C. company that
supplied the Brigade with forage and rations).</p>

<p>"We want to go half-right from here," I continued, lighting up my
torch for four or five seconds. The track led, however, to the left,
and we slowed our pace. Another two hundred yards and we came to a
junction; one track curved away to the right, the other went back
towards the road.</p>

<p>A high-velocity shell screamed over and burst with a weird startling
flash of flame a hundred yards away. We followed the right-hand path,
and found that it bent to the left again. "This is getting puzzling,"
I said to Wilde in a low voice. "I think we've come right so far," he
replied, "but I shall be glad when we're there."</p>

<p>We went on for another five minutes, the cart following. Then suddenly
the situation became really worrying. We were facing a deep impassable
trench. "Damn!" said Wilde angrily. "I was afraid this would happen."</p>

<p>"I don't think we can be more than a couple of hundred yards from
where we want to get," I answered. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>"It ought to be in that direction.
Let's give 'em a hail."</p>

<p>"They'll be down below&mdash;they won't hear us," said Wilde gloomily.</p>

<p>We stood up on the trench and called first the name of the Brigade and
then the name of the adjutant. Not a sound in reply. We shouted again,
the servants joining in. Another shell, bursting near enough to spray
the mess cart with small fragments! At last we heard a cry, and
shouted harder than ever. A figure came out of the gloom, and I
recognised Stenson, A Battery's round-faced second lieutenant. "Ah!
now we're all right," I called out cheerfully. "You see how we're tied
up," I said, turning to Stenson. "Our headquarters is close to your
battery. Which is the way to it?"</p>

<p>Stenson's face fell. "That's what I was hoping you would tell me," he
replied blankly. "I've lost myself."</p>

<p>There was a groan from Wilde.</p>

<p>"I left the battery about half an hour ago because some one was
shouting outside in the dark," went on Stenson. "I found a major
sitting in a shell-hole; he had lost his way trying to get back to the
railway. I managed to put him right&mdash;now I can't find the battery."</p>

<p>Another voice came from the far side of the trench, and we peered at
the newcomer. It was one of the Brigade orderlies, who also had lost
his way trying to find an infantry battalion headquarters. I examined
him on his sense of direction, but all I got from him was that if he
could reach the road and see the fifth telegraph pole from the wood,
he would know that Brigade Headquarters lay on a line due north.</p>

<p>More shells dropped near, and I began to think of Minnie, our patient
mess-cart mare. We must get her and the cart out of the way as soon as
possible. Close <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>by stood a big Nissen hut, sunk half-way below
ground. After consulting with Wilde, I told the servants to unload the
cart and carry the stuff into the hut. The cart having gone, we went
inside; and, lighting a candle, discovered the usual empty bottles and
scattered German illustrated periodicals that indicate a not too
hurried Boche evacuation. After a ten minutes' wait, during which the
Boche shelling increased in intensity, Stenson, the orderly, and
myself went forth with my torch, bent upon trying all the tracks
within reach until we found the right one. And though we twice
followed ways that disappointed us, and turned and searched with a
bitter sense of bafflement, our final path led in the direction to
which I had first pointed. We found ourselves close to the
shell-stricken hut where I had met Beale of A Battery earlier in the
evening. "I know where we are now," I shouted hilariously.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" called some one sharply. I turned my torch on to the
owner of the voice. It was Kelly of D Battery, yet another lost soul.
"I'm hanged if I know where I am," he explained angrily. "I can't find
the battery. I was going to lie down inside here until it got light,
... but I have no matches, and I put my hand on a clammy dead Boche."</p>

<p>"Get away with you!" I laughed. "That's a dead horse. I saw it this
afternoon."</p>

<p>Sure of my ground now, I walked comfortably towards the dug-out where
Major Mallaby-Kelby and the adjutant were waiting. It was 11.15
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> now. Tired and hungry and without candles, they had
fallen asleep.</p>

<p>"By Gad! you're back," ejaculated the major when I touched him....
"Have you brought my white wine?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>"It is coming, sir, before very long," I responded soothingly.</p>

<p>I stood outside, flashed my torch, and yelled for Wilde. An answering
shout was succeeded by Wilde himself. "Why, we were quite close all
the time," he said in surprise.</p>

<p>"Now you go back with the orderly and bring Meddings over with
something to eat," I went on, "every one's famished." Soon Meddings
arrived, striding across shell-holes and treacherous ground with a
heavy mess-box balanced on his head.</p>

<p>"Only bully beef to-night, sir," said Meddings to the expectant major
as he dumped the box on the floor of the hut.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I can eat anything, a crust or a dog-biscuit, I'm so
hungry."</p>

<p>Meddings raised the lid and we all crowded round. "By Gad! this is too
much," snapped the major.</p>

<p>The box contained nothing but cups and plates and saucers.</p>

<p>When Meddings returned with a second box the major and the adjutant
seized some biscuits and munched happily and voraciously. "You
devils," said the major, grinning reproachfully at Wilde and myself,
"I bet you had whiskies-and-sodas at the waggon line. Why were you so
long?"</p>

<p>We didn't go into full explanations then, and I must confess that when
the major, in his haste, knocked the bottle of white wine off the
table and smashed it, Wilde and myself could scarcely forbear a
chuckle. That ought, of course, to be the climax of the story; but it
wasn't. I had put two bottles of the major's white wine into the mess
cart, so the concluding note was one of content. Also I might add,
Stenson called upon us to say that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>A Battery's mess cart had failed
to arrive, and four foodless officers asked us to have pity upon them.
So A Battery received a loaf and a big slab of the truly excellent
piece of bully, a special kind that Meddings had obtained in some
mysterious fashion from a field ambulance that was making a hurried
move. "You two fellows have earned your supper," said the now peaceful
major to Wilde and myself. "I didn't think you were going to have so
trying a journey." We ate bully sandwiches solidly until 1
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> Then the major and the adjutant descended to their
little room below ground. I glanced through 'The Times,' and then
Wilde and myself found a restful bed upon the shavings. The cook and
the servants had gone back to the Nissen hut.</p>

<p>The major's last words as he fell asleep were, "I've to be at the &nbsp;&mdash;th
Infantry Brigade Headquarters at 4.45 in the morning. I think I'll
take the adjutant with me.... No,"&mdash;sleepily,&mdash;"you'd better come,
Wilde."</p>

<p>At 4 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>, when the major's servant woke us, the major called
up the stairs to me, "I think, after all, you'd better come with me."
As I had not removed my boots, it didn't take me long to be up and
ready.</p>

<p>Before we were fifty yards from the hut the major and I shared in one
of the narrowest escapes that have befallen me in France. We heard the
shell coming just in time to crouch. According to Meddings, who stood
in the doorway of the hut, it fell ten yards from us. Smothered with
earth, we moved forward rapidly immediately we regained our feet.</p>

<p>"We shall be right for the rest of the day after that," panted the
major. "The &nbsp;&mdash;th Brigade are in the bank along the road from Leuze
Wood to Combles," <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>he added, reading from a message form. As we left
the dewy grass land and got on to the road that led through the wood,
other shells whistled by, but none of them near enough to set our
nerves tingling again. Indeed the state of mind of both of us seemed
sanguine and rose-coloured. "Fine bit of country this," said the major
in his quick jerky way, "and that purple haze is quite beautiful. It
ought to be lighter than this. It's not even half morning light
yet.... My old uncle in County Clare would be sure to call it dusk. He
often used to say when we were arranging a day's fishing, 'Let me see,
it will still be dusk at 5 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>'"</p>

<p>The major drew an envelope from his pocket and fixed his eyeglass.
"Awkward thing sometimes having a double-barrelled name," he
continued. "I remember a bright young subaltern in a reserve brigade
in England, whose name was Maddock-Smith, or something like that. He
complained that the brigade clerk had not noticed the hyphen, and that
he was down to do double duty as orderly officer&mdash;once as Maddock and
once as Smith."</p>

<p>We were now through the wood, and walking down the hill direct to
Combles. Everything seemed profoundly quiet; not a soul in the road
save ourselves. "Seems strange," observed the major, frowning.
"Infantry Brigade Headquarters ought to be about here. They can't be
much farther off. The starting line is only a few hundred yards away."</p>

<p>"You'd certainly expect to see plenty of messengers and runners near a
brigade headquarters," I put in. "Hullo! here's some one on a
bicycle."</p>

<p>It was a New Zealand officer. "Can you tell me where the &nbsp;&mdash;th Brigade
Headquarters are?" he asked.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>"We are looking for them ourselves," replied the major. "I've to be
there by 4.45, and it's past that now."</p>

<p>We went down to where a track crossed the road at right angles. Still
no one in sight. "Don't understand it," remarked the New Zealand
officer. "I'm going back for more information."</p>

<p>The major and I remained about five minutes longer watching the haze
that enveloped the village below commence to lift. Then suddenly we
heard the sharp metallic crack of quick-firing guns behind, and dozens
of 18-pdr. shells whistled above us. The barrage had started.</p>

<p>Almost immediately red Very lights went up within a stone's-throw as
it seemed to me. And now Boche lights leapt up on our left where the
haze prevented us seeing the Morval ridge, the highest ground in the
neighbourhood, and still in enemy hands. Presently the devilish rattle
of machine-guns rapped out, spreading round the half-circle along
which the alarm lights were still soaring heavenwards.</p>

<p>"We can't do anything by staying here," decided the major. "My place
is with the Infantry Brigade, and I must find them."</p>

<p>"We can report, at any rate, that the Boche lights went up within a
few seconds of the start of our barrage, and that the enemy artillery
replied within four minutes," I remarked, looking at my wrist-watch,
as shells from the direction of the Boche lines poured through the
air.</p>

<p>"Yes, we can say that," responded the major, "and &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;, keep down!" he
called out violently.</p>

<p>A number of bullets had swished swiftly past us. We kept close to the
bank and walked, bending down, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>until we came again to the sunken
portion of the road.</p>

<p>"We can also report that this road was subjected to machine-gun fire,"
concluded the major pointedly.</p>

<p>We ducked again with startled celerity just before reaching the wood.
This time it was a short-range shell from one of our own guns&mdash;there
was no mistaking the wheezy, tinny sound of its passage through the
air. It fell in front of us on the edge of the road, and delivered its
shrapnel as vengefully as if it had fallen in the Boche lines. As we
came beyond the wood we met young Stenson with a small party of
gunners. His face shone with expectancy. He was on the way to man the
forward gun that A Battery had placed overnight under cover of a bank
not far from the road the major and I had just walked along.</p>

<p>"Well, old fellow," remarked the major, removing his steel helmet when
we got back to headquarters, "a cup of tea, and you'd better go
straight down to those trenches the other side of Guillemont and
inquire what has become of the Infantry Brigade. And you can deliver
our reconnoitring report."</p>

<p>It was a long walk, and I resolved to pick up my horse for the return
journey. The Infantry brigadier was taking an early cup of tea when I
found his headquarters. His brigade-major told me that there had been
a change of plan, and the Brigade did not come forward, as previously
arranged. "We couldn't find you to let you know," he explained. "Show
me the position of your headquarters on the map.... Oh, we have our
advanced headquarters not three hundred yards from you, and you will
find the 2nd &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; headquarters near there too.... I'm sorry we <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>didn't
let you know last night. But none of our despatch-riders could find
you."</p>

<p>I rode back the best part of the way, and found the major, the
adjutant, and Wilde fortifying themselves with eggs and bacon.</p>

<p>"We'll look round for a better protected headquarters than this after
breakfast," said the major briskly.</p>

<p>"When I've had a shave, sir," I answered appealingly. "I can't
maintain my efficiency without a shave, you know."</p>

<h3>X. A MASTERLY TURNING MOVEMENT<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>August 30: Before noon we learned that the battle had gone not
altogether our way. Our own Divisional Infantry had fought well and
scattered the Boche in the low-lying village of Combles, but the
Division on our left had failed to force the enemy from the Morval
Heights. Consequently our infantry had been ordered to withdraw their
line slightly, while it remained impossible for the Field Artillery to
push forward so long as the Boche observers possessed the Morval
ridge.</p>

<p>Our batteries, with an S.O.S. range of 1700 yards, were close enough,
as it was, to startle strict adherents of siege-war principles. Indeed
A Battery's forward section, handled first by Dumble and then by
Stenson, had boldly harassed the enemy machine-gunners from under 500
yards' range. Dumble had already been recommended for the Military
Cross, and Major Bullivant described Stenson's exploits while visiting
Brigade Headquarters during the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Yesterday," he told Major Mallaby-Kelby, "he took a sniping gun on to
the crest, and kept it in action for four hours, firing 150 rounds. At
one time he was within three hundred yards of the enemy. He wiped out
at least two infantry teams and waggons&mdash;although the Boche tried hard
to knock his gun out with 5&middot;9's and whizz-bangs. This morning he fired
500 rounds <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>over open sights, and the colonel of the &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;s tells me he
helped our infantry a lot. I understand that more than once, when his
gunners got tired, he 'layed' the gun himself&mdash;not part of an
officer's work, perhaps&mdash;but he's a very sound youngster, and I should
like to get him something."</p>

<p>"I shall be pleased indeed to put him in," responded Major
Mallaby-Kelby. "A word from the infantry would, of course, help."</p>

<p>Our new headquarters, nearer to the Boche depot, consisted simply of a
deep stairless shaft with a 40 degrees slope. The props supporting the
roof were fusty with mildew and fungus, but the entrance faced away
from the German guns. As the colonel of the 2nd &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;s was keen to be
in liaison with us, he and his adjutant and a couple of signallers
shared the shaft. The servants gathered clean straw from the German
dump and strewed it down the shaft. Major Mallaby-Kelby and the
colonel, a slim soft-voiced young man at least twenty-six years of
age, with a proved reputation for bravery and organising powers, had
their blankets laid side by side at the top of the shaft; the two
adjutants, plus telephones, came next; then a couple of signallers
with telephone switch-boards; and, lowest of all, the doctor and
myself. Wilde and his signallers, the cook and his servants, had
installed themselves in a roomy hut stuck in a big bank thirty yards
away. There was a sort of well at the top of the shaft, with steps cut
in the earth, leading down from the ground-level. We fastened a
tarpaulin across the top of the well and made it our mess. It was not
unwise to pick such a well-shielded nook; the Boche gunners flung
shells about more in this neighbourhood than along the slope where the
batteries were situated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>We slept three nights in the shaft. Each morning on awaking I
discovered that I had slipped a couple of yards downhill. I made
further full acquaintance, too, with the completeness of the doctor's
snoring capabilities. Down in that shaft he must have introduced a new
orgy of nasal sounds. It commenced with a gentle snuffling that rather
resembled the rustling of the waters against the bows of a racing
yacht, and then in smooth even stages crescendoed into one grand
triumphant blare.</p>

<p>September 1 proved a day of glory in the history of the Division.
Conferences of Generals, and dashing to and fro of despatch-riders,
produced ambitious plans for an advance that would more than make up
for the set-back of August 30. A brigade of our own Divisional
Infantry was again to descend upon the village of Combles, while
another brigade, working on the flank, would effect a turning movement
northwards towards Fregicourt, a hamlet twelve hundred yards
north-east of Combles. Meanwhile the Division on our left intended to
make a desperate effort to free the Morval Heights.</p>

<p>My task was to be brigade liaison officer with the &nbsp;&mdash;th Infantry
Brigade, who had come up overnight to a quarry a quarter of a mile
beyond D Battery's position. It was a crisp invigorating day, with a
nip in the air that foretold the approach of autumn, and it would have
been a pleasant walk along the valley had not one constantly to get to
leeward of the dead horses that littered the way. And I shall always
recall a small log-cabin that stood isolated in the centre of the
valley&mdash;the sort of place that could mean lone settlers or hermit
hunters to imaginative boyhood. I felt drawn to the hut. The door hung
ajar and I looked in. A <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>young German infantry soldier, dead, his face
palely putty-like, his arms hanging loose, sat on a bench before a
plain wooden table. There was no disorder in the hut. Many a time have
I seen sleeping men in more grotesque attitudes. But the open jacket
and the blood-stained shirt told probably of a miserable being who had
crept inside to die.</p>

<p>A red triangular flag hanging limply from a lance stuck in the
chalk-bank near a roughly-contrived tarpaulin and pit-prop shelter
revealed the infantry brigadier's headquarters. The Brigade signalling
officer hailed me from a dug-out that flew the blue and white of the
signalling company. Outside the brigade-major's hut I found Captain
Drysdale of D Battery, and two other gunner officers. "We are kicking
our heels, waiting for news like newspaper correspondents during a
Cabinet crisis," said Drysdale with a bored smile. "I can't see why
they want so many liaison officers.... I went without my dinner to get
here from the waggon line last night, and haven't had breakfast yet;
and these people haven't told us a scrap of news yet."</p>

<p>"You're doing liaison for Division, aren't you?" I said, "and I'm for
Brigade. They can't need us both."</p>

<p>"Except that the General told me he might require me to go forward
with him to look for targets," replied Drysdale.</p>

<p>"Well, if you like, you slip along to the battery for breakfast. I'll
hold the fort until you come back."</p>

<p>There was, indeed, until well on in the morning, surprisingly little
information to be telephoned to the Artillery. What news the Infantry
brigade-major did receive, however, was all to the good. The
battalions that went into Combles were going strong, and the
mopping-up was being done with the old-soldier <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>thoroughness that so
many of the young lads who only learnt war during the summer advance
seemed to acquire so rapidly. One of the companies engaged in the
turning movement had paid the penalty of over-eagerness, and losing
touch with a sister company had been badly enfiladed by German
machine-gunners; but another company had rushed up to fill their place
and the movement was progressing towards its appointed end.</p>

<p>A dozen Boche prisoners were brought in, dirty, hollow-eyed, and
furtive. "This one speaks English, sir," said the dapper little
private of the East &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;s, who had charge of the party, addressing an
intelligence officer.</p>

<p>I spoke afterwards to this prisoner, a dark pale-faced infantry man
with staring eyes. His English was fair, although he told me he had
only visited England once, for a fortnight&mdash;in London and Manchester.
He had been a telephone manufacturer's employee.</p>

<p>"You were in Combles when you were captured?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"How long had you been in the line?"</p>

<p>"Four days; we went down to Combles yesterday morning."</p>

<p>"Did your rations get up last night?" I proceeded, thinking of our
all-night burst of fire on enemy cross-roads and approaches.</p>

<p>"We took ours with us, but none came for the others there. They had
had nothing for two days."</p>

<p>The marching away of the prisoners prevented further questions. Soon
the Divisional Commander with his attendant staff came up, and a
conference in the brigadier's headquarters was commenced. After half
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>an hour the G.O.C. came out. His demeanour betokened satisfaction. The
manner in which he turned to speak parting words to the brigadier
indicated further activities. A captain of the West &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;s, who had
been in reserve, turned from watching him, and said to me, "I expect
we shall be performing this afternoon." Soon the phrase, "exploiting
initial success," ran from tongue to tongue.</p>

<p>This was the message that at noon I telephoned to our adjutant:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>7th &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;s and East &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;s will push forward fighting patrols to
exploit success in an easterly and north-easterly direction into
St Pierre Vaast Wood, and along the road to S&mdash;&mdash;. Patrols will
not penetrate into squares X 120 and Z 130, as &nbsp;&mdash;th Division
will continue its advance in Y 140, a and c, under a barrage
very shortly.</p>

<p>Artillery have been given tasks of harassing fire east of St
Pierre Vaast Wood, and will not fire west of line eastern edge
of this wood to A 210, b 05.</p>

<p>Patrols must be pushed out without delay, as it is the intention
of the Divisional Commander to exploit initial success with
another brigade to-day.</p></div>

<p>"That's the stuff to give 'em," chortled the Brigade signalling
officer, who had been whipping round similar messages to various
units.</p>

<p>More prisoners kept coming in; the brigade-major's telephone rang
furiously; a heavily-moustached infantry signaller, with a bar to his
Military Medal, just back from the eastern side of Combles, was
telling his pals how an officer and himself had stalked a Hun sniper.
"He was in a hole behind some trees," he said, "and we were walkin'
along, when he hit old Alf in the foot&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>"Is old Alf all right?" asked another signaller quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes"&mdash;nodding and grinning&mdash;"he's got a nice Blighty&mdash;he's all
right.... As I was sayin', he hit old Alf in the foot, and Mr Biles
says to me, 'We'll get that blighter.' So we dropped, and Mr Biles
crawled away to the right and I went to the left. He popped off again
after about five minutes, and I saw where the shot came from. He had
two other goes, and the second time I saw his head. The next time he
popped up I loosed off.... We went to have a look afterwards. I'd got
him right under the ear."</p>

<p>At three o'clock the brigade-major complained to us that some 18-pdrs.
were shooting short. "They mustn't fire in that square," he said
excitedly, "we're still mopping up there."</p>

<p>I telephoned to our adjutant, who said he would speak to our
batteries. "We are not firing there at all," he informed me five
minutes afterwards, and I reported to the brigade-major.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the brigade-major rushed angrily out of his hut.
"Look here!" he said, "that artillery fire has started again. They've
killed a subaltern and a sergeant of the East &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;s. You must do
something!"</p>

<p>I rang up the adjutant again. "It isn't our people," he replied
tersely. "It might be the &nbsp;&mdash;th Division on our left," I suggested.
"Can you get on to them?"</p>

<p>"I'll get Division to speak to them," he replied.</p>

<p>By five o'clock the number of prisoners roped in by the Division was
not far short of a thousand; the Division on the left had gained the
Morval ridge, and this, combined with the turning movement from the
south, had brought about something like debacle among the enemy forces
opposed to us. "That's topping," said <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>the brigade-major when
receiving one particular telephone report, and he looked up with a
laugh. "The &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;s have captured a Boche ambulance waggon, and they
have sent it down for receipt on delivery, with horses and driver
complete."</p>

<p>Not long afterwards I met Major Veasey, hot and radiant after one of
the big adventures of the day. He had gone forward with Kelly, and
discovered that the infantry were held up by fierce machine-gun fire.
"I was afraid all the time that the major's white breeches would give
the show away," Kelly told me, "but we crawled on our bellies to about
a hundred yards from the machine-guns&mdash;there were two of 'em&mdash;and got
the exact spot. We went back and told the battery where to fire, and
then went forward for another look."</p>

<p>"By Jove, we did pepper 'em. And, hang me, if the major didn't say we
must go and make absolutely sure that we had outed 'em. There were
nineteen Boches in the trench, and they surrendered to the major....
Look at this pile of revolvers we took from them&mdash;fourteen altogether.
The major's promised to give this little beauty to the doctor."</p>

<p>And still the day's tale of triumph was not concluded. At seven
o'clock the infantry battalion that had been held in reserve made a
combined dash with troops of the Division on the left, and drove the
tired dispirited Huns out of Sailly-Saillisel, another 2000 yards on.</p>

<p>Our batteries fired harassing crashes all through the night, and were
warned to be ready to move first thing in the morning.</p>

<h3>XI. ON THE HEELS OF THE BOCHE<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>Sept. 2: The side-spectacle that struck me most when I walked by
myself through Combles was that of a solitary Royal Engineer playing a
grand piano in the open street, with not a soul to listen to him. The
house from which the instrument had been dragged was smashed beyond
repair; save for some scrapes on the varnish the piano had suffered no
harm, and its tone was agreeable to the ear. The pianist possessed
technique and played with feeling and earnestness, and it seemed
weirdly strange to hear Schumann's "Slumber Song" in such
surroundings. But the war has produced more impressive incongruities
than that.</p>

<p>The Brigade settled itself in the neighbourhood of Fregicourt. The
&mdash;st Infantry Brigade was already established there in a trench; and
the first job of work that fell to me was to answer the F.O.O. of
another Artillery brigade who had rung up Infantry Brigade
Headquarters. "Huns are moving along the road in X 429 b and c," said
a voice. "Can you turn one of my batteries on to them?" Our batteries
were not yet in position, but I saw, a couple of hundred yards away,
two batteries whose trails were lowered; so I hurried across and gave
them the target and the map spotting, and before long 18-pdr. shells
were on their way to ginger up the aforementioned unlucky Huns. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>An
aeroplane fight within decent observing distance aroused much more
interest. No decisive result was obtained, but the enemy airman was
finally driven away in full retreat towards his own lines. "Jerry
isn't as cheeky as he used to be in Flanders last year, is he?" said
Wilde to me. "It must be true that he's running short of 'planes."</p>

<p>The problem of the last few days had been the water supply for the
horses. Although the sappers were hard at work in Combles, there was
as yet no water within five miles of the batteries. The Boche by
smashing all the power-pumps had seen to that; and the waggon lines
were too far in rear for moving warfare. "We shall be all right when
we get to the canal," had been everybody's consolatory pronouncement.
"The horses won't be so hard worked then."</p>

<p>We were still in the area of newly-erected Boche huts, and
Headquarters lay that night without considerable hardship. Manning,
our mess waiter, a fish-monger by trade, had discovered a large
quantity of dried fish left by the departing enemy, and the men
enjoyed quite a feast; the sudden appearance in new boots of ninety
per cent of them could be similarly explained. The modern soldier is
not squeamish in these matters. I overheard one man, who had accepted
a pair of leggings from a prisoner, reply to a comrade's mild sneer,
"Why not?... I'd take anything from these devils. There was a big
brute this morning: I had a good mind to take his false teeth&mdash;they
had so much gold in 'em." Which rather suggested that he was "telling
the tale" to his unsympathetic listener.</p>

<p>Late that night orders informed us that on the morrow we should come
under another Divisional <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>Artillery. Our own infantry were being
pulled out of the line to bring themselves up to strength. The enemy
were still withdrawing, and fresh British troops had to push ahead so
as to allow him no respite. A Battery had already advanced their guns
another 2000 yards, and through the night fired hotly on the road and
approaches east of the canal. Next morning Major Mallaby-Kelby was
instructed to reconnoitre positions within easy crossing distance of
the canal, but not to move the batteries until further orders came in.
Bicycle orderlies chased down to the waggon lines to tell the grooms
to bring up our horses. My groom, I remember, had trouble on the road,
and did not arrive soon enough for the impatient major; so I borrowed
the adjutant's second horse as well as his groom. A quarter of a mile
on the way I realised that I had forgotten my box-respirator; the only
solution of the difficulty was to take the groom's, and send him back
to remain in possession of mine until I returned; and all that morning
and afternoon I was haunted by the fear that I might perhaps be
compelled to put on the borrowed article.</p>

<p>The reconnoitring party consisted of Major Mallaby-Kelby, Major
Veasey, Major Bullivant, young Beale of A Battery, and Kelly and Wood
of D Battery, who loaded themselves with a No. 4 Director, the tripod
instrument with which lines of fire are laid out.</p>

<p>When we approached the highest point along the main road leading east,
Major Mallaby-Kelby sent back word that the road was under
observation; we must come along in couples, two hundred yards between
each couple. The Boche was sending over some of the high-bursting
shells which he uses so much for ranging purposes, but we were not
greatly troubled. We dipped <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>into a slippery shell-scarred track that
wound through a hummocky copse, swung southwards along a sunken road,
and then made due east again, drawing nearer a dense forest of stubby
firs that stretched far as eye could see. This was the wood into which
our infantry had pushed fighting patrols on Sept. 1. Every few yards
we met grim reminders of the bloody fighting that had made the spot a
memorable battle-ground. My horse shied at two huddled grey forms
lying by the roadside&mdash;bayoneted Huns. I caught a glimpse of one dead
German, half covered by bushes; his face had been blown away.
Abandoned heaps of Boche ammunition; fresh gaping shell-holes; one
ghastly litter of mutilated horses and men, and a waggon rolled into
the ditch, revealed the hellish execution of our artillery. The major
called a halt and said we would leave our horses there.</p>

<p>We struck north-east, away from the forest, and, reaching the
cross-roads on top of the crest, gazed across the great wide valley
that from the canal sloped up to the blue haze of heights still held
by the enemy. Through the glasses one saw the yellows and greens of
bracken and moss and grass in the middle distances. "We're getting
into country now that hasn't seen much shelling," remarked the major
with satisfaction. But the glasses also showed slopes seared and
seamed with twisting trenches and tawny waggon tracks.</p>

<p>Our path lay along a road bordered by evenly-planted, broken and
lifeless poplars. The major called out for us to advance in single
file, at intervals of twenty-five yards. When high-velocity shells
struck the ground a hundred yards short of the road and a hundred
yards beyond it, we all of us dropped unquestioningly into the narrow
freshly-dug trench that ran at the foot of the poplars. About <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>five
hundred yards on, to the left of the road, we passed a shell-blasted
grove that hung above a melancholy rubbish-heap of broken bricks and
shattered timber.</p>

<p>"Government Farm!" called Major Mallaby-Kelby, with an informative
gesture.</p>

<p>Government Farm was a datum point that batteries had mercilessly
pasted two days before.</p>

<p>"Government Farm!" repeated Major Bullivant, who walked behind
Mallaby-Kelby.</p>

<p>"Government Farm!" echoed Major Veasey, with out-stretched arm; and I,
in my turn, passed the word to Beale.</p>

<p>Young Beale was in exuberant spirits. He not only turned his head and
shouted "Government Farm!" with a parade-ground volume of voice; he
followed with the clarion demand of "Why don't you acknowledge
orders?" to Kelly, who was so surprised that he nearly dropped the
Director before responding with a grin, and thrusting out his arm in
the way laid down in the gun-drill book for sergeants to acknowledge
gunnery orders passed along the line of guns.</p>

<p>We came to another large wood that stretched down towards the canal,
and, once more in a party, moved along the southern edge of it. An
infantry captain, belonging to the Division we were now working under,
stepped from beneath the trees and saluted. "We're reconnoitring for
battery positions," said Major Mallaby-Kelby, answering the salute.
"Can you tell me how the front line runs now?"</p>

<p>"We're sending two patrols through the wood to the canal now," replied
the captain, "The Boche hadn't entirely cleared out three-quarters of
an hour ago."</p>

<p>"We may as well go on," said Major Mallaby-Kelby, after three or four
minutes further conversation. "The <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>Boche must be over the canal by
now ... and we have to select battery positions as soon as possible.
We don't want to bring the guns up in the dark." There was a general
feeling for revolvers, and we entered the wood and followed a
bridle-path. I could imagine that wood in the pleasant careless days
of peace, a proper wood for picnics and nutting expeditions. Ripening
blackberries even now loaded the bramble bushes, but the foul
noxiousness of gas shells had made them uneatable. The heavy sickly
smell of phosgene pervaded the close air; no birds fluttered and piped
among the upper branches. The heavy steel helmet caused rills of sweat
to run down the cheeks.</p>

<p>We forged ahead past a spacious glade where six tracks met. "There's a
hut we could use for a mess," said Major Veasey. "Mark it up, Kelly;
and look at that barrel, it would be big enough for you to sleep in."
Snapped-off branches, and holes torn in the leaf-strewn ground, showed
that the guns had not neglected this part of the wood; and in several
places we noted narrow ruts a yard or so in length, caused by
small-calibre projectiles. "Ricochet shots from whizz-bangs fired at
very close range," commented Major Bullivant.</p>

<p>After certain hesitations as to the right track to follow, we reached
the north-western edge of the wood. Major Mallaby-Kelby refused to
allow us to leave cover, and we knelt hidden among the prickly bushes.
"For heaven's sake don't show these white breeches, Veasey," laughed
Major Bullivant.</p>

<p>A village nestled at the foot of the slope. Not a sign of life in it
now, although the Boche was certainly in possession the day before.
"There are some Boches in that trench near the top of the slope," said
Major Veasey suddenly. "Can you see them? Eight degrees, two <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>o'clock,
from the farm chimney near the quarry." I looked hard and counted
three steel helmets. "We could have some good shooting if we had the
guns up," added the major regretfully. A Boche 5&middot;9 was firing
consistently and accurately into the valley beneath us. I say
accurately, because the shells fell round and about one particular
spot. "Don't see what he's aiming at," said Major Bullivant shortly.
"He's doing no damage.... He can't be observing his fire."</p>

<p>There was a discussion as to whether an 18-pdr. battery placed near a
long bank on the slope would be able to clear the wood at 3000 yards'
range, and Major Mallaby-Kelby and Major Bullivant slipped out to
inspect a possible position at the corner where the edge of the wood
curved north-east. Then Major Mallaby-Kelby decided that it was time
to return; and on the way back Major Veasey said he would be content
to bring his 4&middot;5 how. battery into the glade where the six tracks met.
"Might as well make us trench mortars," growled Kelly to me. "We
shan't be more than a thousand yards from the Boche."</p>

<p>Just before we came out of the wood Major Mallaby-Kelby called to me
to chalk the sign of Brigade H.Q. on an elaborate hut that stood forty
yards off the track&mdash;a four-roomed hut, new and clean. It was not
pleasant, however, to find two dead Boche horses lying in the doorway.</p>

<p>An enemy bombardment started as we left the wood. Major Veasey and his
party went off immediately towards where the horses were waiting. The
other two majors, still seeking battery positions, bore away to the
south, and I followed them. A 4&middot;2 battery suddenly switched its fire
on to the strip of ground we were crossing, and we ran hurriedly for
shelter to a trench that lay handy. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>Shells whistled over our heads,
and we panted and mopped our brows while taking a breather.</p>

<p>"No wonder he's shelling here," exclaimed Major Mallaby-Kelby. "The
&mdash;rd" [our companion Brigade] "have a battery here.... Look at those
dead horses ... three, five, seven&mdash;why, there are twelve of 'em."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," I put in, "that happened yesterday when they were bringing
up ammunition."</p>

<p>We moved up the trench, but we seemed to draw fire as if we had
magnetic properties. "We'll move back again," remarked Major
Mallaby-Kelby with energy, and he started off, Major Bullivant
following.</p>

<p>We had gone about fifty yards when Major Bullivant turned swiftly,
gave me a push, and muttered "Gas!" We ran back to where we had been
before, and looked round for Major Mallaby-Kelby. "Damn it," he said
abruptly when he came up, sneezing, "I forgot to bolt. I stood still
getting my box-respirator on."</p>

<p>When the shelling died down we walked farther along the trench, which
turned westwards. Excellent positions for the three 18-pdr. batteries
were found not far from the trench; and returning again towards the
wood for our horses, we chanced upon a deep dug-out that Major
Mallaby-Kelby sent me down to explore. "Don't touch any wires or
pegs," he said warningly; "the Hun may have left some booby-traps."
The dug-out was thirty feet deep, and had only one entrance. But I
found recesses with good wire beds, and a place for the telephonists.
"We'll make that Headquarters," decided the major, and I chalked out
our claim accordingly.</p>

<p>When we got back to the batteries we found that orders for the move
had come in; the teams were up; and after a very welcome cup of tea
the journey to the new positions was started. Wilde, the signalling
officer, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>and myself led the way with the Headquarters' vehicles, and
followed a beautifully hidden track that ran through the wood and came
out a hundred yards from our selected dug-out. Three red glares lit up
the sky behind the heights held by the Boche. "By Jove," said Wilde,
"he must be going back; he's burning things."</p>

<p>My day's work was not yet ended. Our own infantry had been brought up
again, and it was imperative that we should be in early communication
with the &nbsp;&mdash;rd Brigade, the Brigade commanded by the forceful young
brigadier who had discussed artillery arrangements with the colonel
for the operation in which Judd and Pottinger had done so well with
their forward section. There was a shortage of telephone wire, and at
8.15 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> Wilde's line had not been laid. Major Mallaby-Kelby
decided that the only alternative was for me to go and report to the
brigadier, whose headquarters were not far from the road leading to
Senate Farm. It was very dark, and the fact that the whole way was
under Boche observation made it impossible for me to use my torch.
Shells were falling about the cross-roads&mdash;and I have undertaken more
agreeable walks. I went down into the Infantry brigade signal-hut
first to find whether we had at last got a line through. We hadn't.
When I asked for the General's mess, the signalling sergeant conducted
me along a passage that in places was not three feet high. Climbing up
a steep uneven stairway, I found myself at the top looking into the
mess with only my head and shoulders exposed to view. The General was
examining a map. His brigade-major, a V.C. captain with gentle eyes
and a kindly charming manner; his staff captain, a brisk hard-bitten
soldier, with a reputation for never letting the Brigade go hungry;
the signal officer, the intelligence officer, and other junior members
of the staff, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>were seated round the same table. "What about the &nbsp;&mdash;nd
Brigade?" I heard the General say, mentioning our Brigade.</p>

<p>"We haven't heard from them yet," observed the brigade-major.</p>

<p>"I'm from the &nbsp;&mdash;nd Brigade," I said loudly.</p>

<p>There were startled ejaculations and a general looking round to the
spot where the voice came from.</p>

<p>"Hallo, Jack-in-the-box!" exclaimed the brigadier, staring at my head
and shoulders, "where did you come from?"</p>

<p>I explained, and the General, laughing, said, "Well, you deserve a
drink for that.... Come out of your box and we'll give you some
targets.... I didn't know any one could get in that way."</p>

<p>Before I went away the tactical situation was explained to me. I was
given the points the Infantry would like us to fire upon during the
night. Also I got my drink.</p>

<p>The last thing Major Mallaby-Kelby said before going off to sleep was,
"Extraordinary long time since we met any civilians. Haven't seen any
since July."</p>

<h3>XII. THE MAJOR'S LOST PIPE<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>Sept. 4: "A full mail-bag and a bottle of white wine are the best
spirit revivers for war-worn fighting-men," said Major Mallaby-Kelby
contentedly, gathering up his own big batch of letters from the one
and sipping a glass of the other.</p>

<p>During two days Brigade Headquarters and the four batteries had
received piles of belated letters and parcels, and there was joy in
the land. I remember noting the large number of little, local, weekly
papers&mdash;always a feature of the men's mail; and it struck me that here
the countryman was vouchsafed a joy unknown to the Londoner. Both
could read of world-doings and national affairs in the big London
dailies; but the man from the shires, from the little country towns,
from the far-off villages of the British Isles, could hug to himself
the weekly that was like another letter from home&mdash;with its intimate,
sometimes trivial, details of persons and places so familiar in the
happy uneventful days before the war.</p>

<p>As for the white wine, that did not greatly interest the other members
of Brigade Headquarters mess. But the diary contained the bald entry,
"At 9.30 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> the whisky ran out," in the space headed Aug.
28; and none had come to us since. People at home are inclined to
believe that the whisky scarcity, and the shortage of cakes and
biscuits, and chocolate and tobacco, scarcely <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>affected officers'
messes in France. It is true that recognised brands of whisky appeared
on the Expeditionary Force Canteens' price-list at from 76 to 80
francs a dozen, but there were days and days when none was to be
bought, and no lime-juice and no bottled lemon-squash either. Many a
fight in the September-October push was waged by non-teetotal
officers, who had nothing with which to disguise the hideous taste of
chlorinate of lime in the drinking water. Ah well!</p>

<p>There was also the serious matter of Major Mallaby-Kelby's pipe. It
became a burning topic on Sept. 4. "I must have dropped it yesterday
when we tumbled into that gas," he told me dolefully. "I mustn't lose
that pipe. It was an original Dunhill, and is worth three or four
pounds.... I'll offer a reward for it.... Will you come with me to
look for it?" And he fixed his monocle and gazed at me compellingly.</p>

<p>"Does the offer of a reward refer to me, sir?" I inquired with all the
brightness at my command. For answer the major commenced putting on
his steel helmet and box-respirator.</p>

<p>It was fitting that I should go. I had accompanied the major on all
his excursions, and my appearance over the horizon had become a sure
warning to the batteries that the major was not far off. "Gunner Major
and Gunner Minor" some one had christened us.</p>

<p>The major conducted the search with great verve. We encountered a
gunner chopping wood, and he told him the story of the pipe. "I'll
give twenty-five francs to any one who brings it to me," he concluded.
The gunner saluted and continued to chop wood.</p>

<p>"Rather a big reward!" I remarked as we walked on.</p>

<p>"Do you think twenty-five too much? Shall I make it fifteen?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>"You've committed yourself now," I answered solemnly.</p>

<p>Our arrival at the trench in which we had sheltered the day before
coincided with the whizz-phutt of a 4&middot;2 dud. "I shall be sorry if I
get you killed looking for my pipe," said the major cheerfully. We
waited for the next shell, which exploded well behind us, and then
hastened to the spot where our quest was really to commence. Four
gunners belonging to the &nbsp;&mdash;rd Brigade stood idly in the trench. The
major stopped and looked down upon them. He addressed himself directly
to a wall-faced, emotionless kind of man whose head and shoulders
showed above the trench top.</p>

<p>"I was down here yesterday," began the major, "and lost my pipe. It
was a very valuable pipe, a pipe I prize very much. I think it must be
somewhere in this trench...."</p>

<p>The wall-faced man remained stolidly silent.</p>

<p>"I want to get it back again," went on the major; "and if any of you
fellows find it and bring it to me&mdash;I'm Major Mallaby-Kelby,
commanding the &nbsp;&mdash;nd Brigade&mdash;I'll give a reward of twenty-five
francs."</p>

<p>"Is this it, sir?" said the wall-faced man in matter-of-fact tones,
whipping out of his pocket a thin-stemmed pipe with a shapely,
beautifully-polished bowl.</p>

<p>"By Jove, that's it!" exclaimed the major, taken aback by the swift
unexpectedness of the recovery. "Yes, by Jove, that's it," he
continued, his face lighting up. He took the pipe and rubbed the bowl
affectionately with the palm of his hand.</p>

<p>"Twenty-five francs reward!" I murmured softly.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's right," he said briskly, and began turning out his
pockets. Three maps, a pocket-handkerchief, some ration biscuits, and
a note-case with nothing in it. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>"You must lend me twenty-five
francs," he declared masterfully.</p>

<p>The wall-faced gunner accepted the money without any sign of repressed
emotion, and saluted smartly. The smiles of the other men broadened
into grins as the major and myself set our faces homewards.</p>

<p>There were more serious matters to consider when we got back. D
Battery had had two men killed by shell fire in the wood; the other
batteries had had to send away a dozen men between them, overcome by
gas; the Infantry brigadier wished to discuss fresh plans for
hastening the enemy's departure from the neighbourhood of the canal.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I accompanied the major on a round of the batteries.
Nests of Boche machine-gunners were still checking the advance of our
infantry&mdash;they had fought heroically these fellows; but slowly,
methodically, implacably the work of rooting them out was going on.
Our farther advance was only a matter of hours now. "We're ordered not
to risk too many casualties on this front," the Infantry brigadier had
told the major. "The enemy will have to fall back when certain
movements north and south of us are completed.... But we mustn't let
him rest." Beale of A Battery had returned from the most crowded
glorious experience of his young life. He had taken a gun forward to
support two companies of the infantry who were striving to establish
posts on the eastern side of the canal. Their progress was stayed by
machine-guns and snipers, and the casualties were beginning to make
the company commanders doubt if the operation was worth while. Beale
reconnoitred with two platoon commanders and located the machine-guns,
returned and brought his gun up, and from an open position fired over
four hundred rounds; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>and afterwards went forward in front of the
advanced posts to make sure that the machine-guns had been definitely
put out of action. This brilliant effort enabled the infantry to move
forward afterwards without a casualty. Dusty, flushed with the thrill
of what he had been through, Beale knew that he had done fine work,
and was frankly pleased by the kind things said about him.</p>

<p>The following day produced fresh excitements. Major Simpson had gone
down to B Battery's waggon line to secure something like a night's
rest&mdash;although I might say that after the spring of 1917 the Boche
night-bombers saw to it that our waggon lines were no longer the
havens of peace they used to be. Disaster followed. The Boche drenched
the battery position with gas. Captain Denny, who had come up from the
waggon line to relieve the major, was caught while working out the
night-firing programme. Overbury, young Bushman, and another officer
were also gassed; and eight men besides. C Battery were victims as
well, and Henry and a number of the gunners had been removed to the
Casualty Clearing Station.</p>

<p>And before lunch-time a briefly-worded order was received directing
Major Mallaby-Kelby to report immediately to a Field Artillery Brigade
of another Division. Orders are apt to arrive in this sudden
peremptory fashion. Within an hour and a half the major had bidden
good-bye to us and ridden off, a mess cart following with his kit. And
Major Veasey came to reign in his stead.</p>

<p>Major Mallaby-Kelby left one souvenir, a bottle of the now famous
white wine which had got mislaid&mdash;at least the cook explained it that
way. The omission provided Brigade Headquarters with the wherewithal
to drink the major's health.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>At nine o'clock that night I stood with Major Veasey outside our
headquarters dug-out. A mizzling rain descended. Five substantial
fires were burning beyond the heights where the Boche lay. "What's the
odds on the war ending by Christmas?" mused the major. "... I give it
until next autumn," he added.</p>

<p>A battery of 60-pounders had come up close by. Their horses, blowing
hard, had halted in front of our dug-out half an hour before, and the
drivers were waiting orders to pull the guns the final three hundred
yards into position. Two specks of lights showed that a couple of them
were smoking cigarettes. "Look at those drivers," I said. "They've
been here all this time and haven't dismounted yet."</p>

<p>The major stepped forward and spoke to one of the men. "Get off, lad,
and give the old horse a rest. He needs it."</p>

<p>"Some of these fellows will never learn horse management though the
war lasts ten years," he said resignedly as he went downstairs.</p>

<p>I remember our third and last night in that dug-out, because the air
below had got so vitiated that candles would only burn with the
feeblest of glimmers.</p>

<h3>XIII. NURLU AND LIERAMONT<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>Sept. 6: The expected orders for the Brigade's farther advance arrived
at 2 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>, and by eight o'clock Wilde and myself had selected
a new headquarters in a trench south of the wood. A tarpaulin and
pit-prop mess had been devised: I had finished the Brigade's official
War Diary for August; dinner was on the way; and we awaited the return
of Major Veasey from a conference with the Infantry brigadier.</p>

<p>The major came out of the darkness saying, "We'll have dinner at once
and then move immediately. There's a show to-morrow, and we must be
over the canal before daybreak.... Heard the splendid news?... We've
got right across the Drocourt Qu&eacute;ant line.... That's one reason why we
are pushing here to-morrow."</p>

<p>We had a four-miles' march before us, and Manning and Meddings, our
mess waiter and cook, farther down the trench, could be heard
grumbling at the prospect of another packing-up, and a search in the
dark for fresh quarters. "We always lose knives and forks and crockery
when we move like this," Manning was saying in his heavy-dragoon
voice.</p>

<p>"You and Wilde had better look for a headquarters somewhere near the
cross-roads at Nurlu," the major told me. "The adjutant and myself
will find where the batteries are and join you later."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>There was a twenty minutes' delay because in the dark the G.S. waggon
had missed us and vanished round the corner of the wood. As we moved
off I felt a wet muzzle against my hand, and, stooping, perceived a
dog that looked like a cross between an Airedale and a Belgian
sheep-dog. "Hullo, little fellow!" I said, patting him. He wagged his
tail and followed me.</p>

<p>The German shelling had died down, and we hoped for an uneventful
journey. But night treks across ground that has been fought over
usually test one's coolness and common-sense. The Boche had blown up
the bridges over the canal, and descending the slope we had to leave
the road and follow a track that led to an Engineers' bridge, so well
hidden among trees that the enemy artillery had not discovered it. But
it was a long time before our little column completed the crossing. A
battery were ahead, and between them and us came a disjointed line of
infantry waggons&mdash;horses floundering in the mud, men with torches
searching for shell-holes and debris that had to be avoided. Only one
vehicle was allowed on the bridge at a time, and a quarter to eleven
came before the six mules scrambled the G.S. waggon over. The real
difficulty, however, was to decide upon the track to take the other
side of the canal. Maps were useless; these were tracks unknown to the
topographers. Not one of them followed the general direction in which
I believed Nurlu to be. I resolved to take the track that went
south-east, and hoped to come upon one that would turn due east. Heavy
shells, one every four minutes, rumbled high overhead, and crashed
violently somewhere south of us. "They are shooting into Moislains,"
said Wilde. We trudged along hopefully.</p>

<p>The dog was still with us, running in small circles <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>round me. "That
must be the sheep-dog part of him," I said to Wilde. "He's a bit thin,
but he seems a wiry little chap."</p>

<p>The looked-for track due east came when I began to think that we were
drawing too near to where the big shells were falling. After half a
mile we reached a metalled road; the track we had passed along went
over and beyond it. The point to be decided now was whether to go
straight on or to turn left along the road. Not a soul, not a single
vehicle in sight; it was hard to believe that three Divisions were to
make a big attack on the morrow. I halted the waggons on the road, and
turned to Wilde. "Let's send Sergeant Starling (the signalling
sergeant) to find where this track leads to. We'll walk up the road
and find some one who can show it us on the map. There are bound to be
dug-outs in this bank."</p>

<p>We walked for half a mile, meeting no one. The dog and an orderly
accompanied us. In the distance my ear caught a familiar sound&mdash;the
clip-clop of horses trotting. It came nearer and nearer. Then we saw a
horseman, wearing the Artillery badge, leading a light draught horse.</p>

<p>"What battery do you belong to?" I asked, stopping him.</p>

<p>"B, sir."</p>

<p>"Where are you going now?"</p>

<p>"A shell came, sir, and hit our waggon. My traces were broke, and I'm
going back to the waggon line, sir."</p>

<p>"Where is B Battery?"</p>

<p>"Up this road, sir, and I think you take a turning on the left, but I
can't quite remember, sir; we had a bit of a mix-up."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>"Bring up the waggons," I told the orderly. "We're on the right road.
If Sergeant Starling isn't back, leave some one behind to bring him
along."</p>

<p>Before long a jingling and a creaking told us that our carts were
close at hand. We walked on, and, reaching a cross-roads, waited to
shout for those behind to keep straight on. Half a minute afterwards I
heard my name called. A single light shone out from a dug-out in the
bank.</p>

<p>It was Garstin of C Battery who had hailed me. "Major Veasey is here
with Major Bartlett," he said, coming towards us. The two majors were
sitting in a dug-out no bigger than a trench-slit. "What do you think
of my quarters?" smiled Major Bartlett. "Sorry I can't ask you to have
a drink. Our mess cart hasn't arrived yet."</p>

<p>"We've found B and C, so far," interposed Major Veasey, puffing at his
pipe, "and I must find the &nbsp;&mdash;th Infantry Brigade before I finish
to-night.... This road takes you direct to Nurlu, you know."</p>

<p>Wilde and I and the headquarters waggons resumed our march. We had
reached a sunken portion of the road, when above us began the deep
steady drone of Boche aeroplanes. We halted the waggons.</p>

<p>A wait, during which Lizzie, the big mare, whinnied, and we looked up
and strained our ears to follow the path of the 'planes. Then, farther
away than the whirring in the skies had led us to expect, came the
ear-stabbing crack of the bombs.
One!&mdash;two!&mdash;three!&mdash;four!&mdash;five!&mdash;six! in as quick succession as
rifle-shots. "Damn 'em," said Wilde apprehensively. "I hope they don't
get any of our horses."</p>

<p>We were quite near Nurlu now, and, leaving the waggons in the shelter
of the sunken road, Wilde and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>I again forged ahead. An Army Field
Brigade was forming its waggon lines in a field off the roadside amid
sharp angry cries of "Keep those lights out!" Soon we approached
another sunken road leading into the village. Through the hedge that
rose above the bank I saw a black oblong hut. "Let's look at this
place," I said.</p>

<p>In the darkness we made out a number of huts. A ring of sandbags
showed where a tent had been pitched. Pushing away the blanket that
covered the opening to a huge mined dug-out, we looked upon a row of
sleeping engineers. "There are plenty of empty huts here," a corporal,
half-awake, told us. It was past midnight. "This will do us for
to-night," I said to Wilde.</p>

<p>A humming overhead reminded us that Boche 'planes still hovered near.
As we came out of the dug-out a string of red lights floated
downwards. A machine-gun spluttered, and a bullet pinged close to us.
"What's he up to?" said Wilde, his eyes gleaming. We drew back. A bomb
fell three hundred yards away; then another, and another. The ground
shook; we thought of our waggons and horses in the road. The dog had
dashed outside.</p>

<p>When the 'planes had passed, I sent the orderly to bring up the
waggons. The horses went back to the other side of the canal; the men
soon found cover for the night. Wilde and I made for the hut that we
had noticed first of all. It was not very spacious&mdash;nor very clean:
but it contained four wire beds to accommodate the major, the
adjutant, Wilde, and myself. "Why, it's a guard-room," I called,
shining my torch on a painted board affixed to the door.</p>

<p>So, for once in our lives, we slept in a guard-room. The little dog
had curled himself up in a corner.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>Sept. 7: Zero hour for the launching of the attack was 8
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>, much later than usual. The village of Lieramont was the
first objective, and afterwards the infantry were to push on and oust
the Boche from Guyencourt and Saulcourt. It was to be an attack on the
grand scale, for the enemy had brought up one fresh Division and two
others of known fighting capacity. He was likely to hold very stoutly
to the high ground at Ep&eacute;hy. Our A Battery was under orders to follow
close on the heels of the infantry, to assist in wiping out
machine-gun nests.</p>

<p>The camp in which we had settled overnight possessed at least three
empty Nissen huts in good condition. The place had been captured from
the British during the March retreat, and retaken not more than three
days ago. Our guard-room sleeping quarters were not roomy enough for
four simultaneous morning toilets; so I had my tin bowl and shaving
articles taken over to one of the Nissen huts, and I stripped and
managed a "bowl-bath" before breakfast. The dog, who had quite taken
possession of me, stretched himself on the floor and kept an eye upon
me.</p>

<p>The wily Boche had improved our Nissen huts. Trap-doors in the wooden
floors and "funk-holes" down below showed how he feared our
night-bombers. Jagged holes in the semicircular iron roofing proved
the wisdom of his precautions.</p>

<p>By half-past eight a German 5&middot;9 was planking shells over the camp,
near enough for flying fragments to rattle against the roof and walls
of the huts. Fifty rounds were fired in twenty minutes. The Boche
gunners varied neither range nor direction; and no one was hurt. The
shelling brought to light, however, a peculiarity of the dog. He
chased away in the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>direction of each exploding shell, and tried also
to pursue the pieces of metal that whizzed through the air. Nothing
would hold him. When he returned, panting, it was to search for water;
but after a short rest the shells lured him out again in vain excited
quest.</p>

<p>Round his neck was a leather collar with a brass plate. The plate bore
the name of a brigadier-general commanding an infantry brigade of a
Division that had gone north. "No wonder he follows you," grinned
Wilde. "He thinks you are a General.... It must be your voice, or the
way you walk."</p>

<p>"More likely that I use the same polish for my leggings as the
General," I retorted.</p>

<p>Major Veasey called me, and we started forth to see how the battle was
progressing. The village of Lieramont had fallen very quickly, and
Major Bullivant had already reported by mounted orderly that his
battery had moved through the village, and come into action near the
sugar factory.</p>

<p>"Oh, the leetle dawg!" said Major Veasey in wheedling tones, fondling
the dog who frisked about him. Then he got his pipe going, and we
strode through desolated Nurlu and made across rolling prairie land,
broken by earthworks and shell-holes. A couple of heavy hows. were
dropping shells on the grassy ridge that rose on our left&mdash;wasted
shots, because no batteries were anywhere near. We stuck to the
valley, and, passing a dressing station where a batch of walking cases
were receiving attention, drew near to the conglomeration of tin huts,
broken walls, and tumbled red roofs that stood for Lieramont. We
stopped to talk to two wounded infantry officers on their way to a
casualty clearing station. The advance had gone well, they said,
except <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>at Saulcourt, which was not yet cleared. They were young and
fresh-coloured, imperturbable in manner, clear in their way of
expressing themselves. One of them, jacketless, had his left forearm
bandaged. Through a tear in his shirt sleeve I noticed the ugly purple
scar of an old wound above the elbow. Odd parties of infantry and
engineers stood about the streets. Plenty of wounded were coming
through. I ran in to examine a house that looked like a possible
headquarters of the future, and looked casually at a well that the
Boche had blown in. The dog was still at my heels.</p>

<p>"Now we want to find the sugar factory to see how Bullivant is getting
on," said the major, refilling his pipe. We pulled out maps and saw
the factory plainly marked; and then followed a hard good-conditioned
road that led over a hill.</p>

<p>We were getting now to a region where shells fell more freely. A mile
to the north-east machine-gun duels were in progress. When we saw the
wrecked factory with its queer-looking machinery&mdash;something like giant
canisters&mdash;we pressed forward. No sign whatever of A Battery! I looked
inside some tin huts: one had been used as a German mess, another as
an officers' bath-house; flies swarmed upon old jam and meat tins;
filth and empty bottles and stumps of candles, a discarded German
uniform, torn Boche prints, and scattered picture periodicals.
"There's no one here," mused Major Veasey. "I suppose the battery has
moved forward again."</p>

<p>Beyond a tangled heap of broken machinery, that included a huge
fly-wheel, bent and cracked, stood a big water-tank, raised aloft on
massive iron standards. "We might be able to see something from up
there," said the major. There was a certain amount of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>swarming to be
done, and the major, giving up the contest, aided me to clamber up.
Out of breath I stood up in the dusty waterless tank, and got out my
binoculars. Towards where the crackle of machine-guns had been heard,
I saw a bush-clad bank. Tucked up against it were horses and guns. Big
Boche shells kept falling near, and the landscape was wreathed in
smoke.</p>

<p>Before we got to the battery we met Major Bullivant, whose gestures
alone were eloquent enough to describe most war scenes. A rippling
sweep of his left arm indicated where two machine-gun nests on the
bosky western slopes of Saulcourt held up our infantry; a swan-like
curl of the right wrist, raised to the level of the shoulder, told
where A Battery had been situated, less than a thousand yards from the
enemy. "A company of the &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; were faltering because of the deadliness
of the machine-guns," he said. "... I got hold of a platoon commander
and he took me far enough forward to detect their whereabouts.... We
fired 200 rounds when I got back to the battery. My gunners popped
them off in find style, although the Boche retaliated.... The infantry
have gone on now.... I found two broken machine-guns and six dead
Germans at the spots we fired at.... It's been quite a good morning's
work."</p>

<p>He smiled an adieu and went off to join a company commander he had
arranged to meet. When we reached the bank A Battery were about to
move to a sunken road farther forward. Smallman, from South Africa,
nicknamed "Buller," was in charge, and he pointed joyously to an
abandoned Boche Red Cross waggon that the battery had "commandeered."
Four mules had been harnessed to it; the battery waggon line was its
destination.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>"Gee-ho! they went off in a hurry from here," remarked Major Veasey,
looking at a light engine and three trucks loaded with ammunition and
corrugated iron that the enemy had failed to get away on the
narrow-gauge line running past Saulcourt. "What we ought to do is to
have a railway ride back. The line goes to Nurlu. That would be a new
experience&mdash;and I'm tired enough."</p>

<p>"Yes, that would be better than the four-in-hand in the G.S. waggon
that you took to the sports meeting," I added.</p>

<p>A Hun 5&middot;9 was firing persistently on a spot 400 yards between
Saulcourt and where we stood. For once in a way the dog neglected
shells, and searched for bully-beef leavings among the tins thrown
aside by the battery drivers. We were not absolutely safe. The Boche
shells were fitted with instantaneous fuses, and after each burst bits
of jagged iron flew off at right angles to points as far distant as
700 yards. As we turned to go a piece whistled over our heads and hit
one of the Red Cross waggon lead-mules. The poor beast dropped and
brought down his frightened, kicking, companion mule also. The drivers
had released them by the time Major Veasey and I came up. The wounded
mule found his feet, and was led a few yards away. A horrible tear, 8
inches long, showed a smashed jawbone and cheekbone; he moved his head
from side to side in his pain. "I shall have to shoot him," said the
major, loading his revolver. The mule stared dully as the major
approached, but drew back sharply when he saw the revolver. The driver
could not hold him properly, and the first bullet-hole was not the
half-inch to an inch below the forelock that means instantaneous
death. The poor animal fell, but got up again and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>staggered away. The
major had to follow and shoot again.</p>

<p>We struck off in a more northerly direction on our way back to Nurlu,
searching for the forward section of B Battery that had been told off
to work in conjunction with a certain Infantry battalion. We met
Wheater, who was commanding the section, and he told the major that he
had not taken his two guns farther forward, because the battalion
commander had gone off in a hurry without giving him instructions,
without even telling him the line the infantry had reached.</p>

<p>"How long have you been here?" asked the major pointedly.</p>

<p>"Three hours, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, my dear fellow, you certainly should have taken your guns
farther forward by now, battalion commander or no battalion commander.
You've got a mounted orderly, and you could have sent him back to
Brigade Headquarters, informing them of your new position. Then you
could have got into touch with the infantry and asked them for
targets. It's useless staying here."</p>

<p>The arrival on horseback of the major-general commanding the Division
attacking in this portion of the front turned the conversation. Not
long appointed to his present command, the General during the March
retreat had been the senior Infantry brigadier in our own Division. He
was a particularly able and resourceful soldier; his first demand was
for information regarding the work done by our forward guns. The major
told him that Wheater's section remained where it was because of the
neglect of the battalion commander.</p>

<p>The General listened quietly, and cast a keen eye upon Wheater, "You
can take your guns up in safety <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>to Guyencourt, and you'll find plenty
to shoot at there. Tell any one who wants to know that your
instructions come direct from the Divisional commander.... And don't
rely too much on battalion commanders. Very few battalion commanders
know anything about artillery. It's a pity, but it's a fact." He
responded with dignity to our salutes, and rode off, followed by his
attendant staff officers and the grooms.</p>

<p>The major got more and more tired of the walking. It was half-past two
now, and we were both pretty hungry. The dog seemed as frisky and
energetic as when he chased the shells at breakfast-time. We passed a
big dressing station; a wheeled stretcher stood outside. "As we didn't
take a train ride, should I push you back in that, major?" I inquired
with due seriousness. Major Veasey smiled, and we started on the last
mile and a half.</p>

<p>There were prospects, we learned when we got back to Nurlu and read
the reports received by the adjutant, of another move forward for the
batteries.</p>

<p>"This looks like bringing the waggon lines over the canal," said the
adjutant, showing the major the following wire from the staff
captain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"Good spring at V 201 b 2.7. Water-cart filling-point being
arranged. Approaches good for water-carts. Troughs now in order
at V 202 c 8.5."</p></div>

<p class="noin">Another message of the same tenor, having to do with gun repairs,
ran&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"No. 347 light shop moves to Moislains to-morrow. Will undertake
quick repairs. Longer jobs will be sent back to Nos. 124 B&mdash;&mdash;
and 192 F&mdash;&mdash;."</p></div>

<p class="noin"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>A third telegram supplied a reminder that the spiteful Boche still
had time to leave devilish traps for the unwary&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"Advanced guard &nbsp;&mdash;th Division found small demolition charges in
Nissen hut at W 123 b 8.9, and mined dug-out W 129 d 3.2."</p></div>

<p>"Yes," remarked Major Veasey, "we are certain to move again to-night.
The wise man will take a lie down until tea-time." And he hied him to
the wire bed in the guard-room.</p>

<hr />

<p>At 8.15 that night Wilde and I, the Headquarters party, and the dog,
having waited an hour and a half for the orderly that Major Veasey had
promised to send back to guide us to a new headquarters, settled in
some old German gun-pits, scooped out of a lofty chalk bank. Our march
had brought us through Lieramont and beyond the shell-mauled cemetery
where the Boche in his quest of safety had transformed the very vaults
into dug-outs.</p>

<p>The horses were sent back to the waggon line and the drivers told to
bring them up again at 6 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>; and I was arranging the relief
of the orderly stationed on the roadside to look out for the major
when the major's special war-whoop broke cheerily through the
darkness. "The opening of the gun-pit faces the wrong way, and we have
no protection from shells&mdash;but the tarpaulin will keep any rain out,"
was the best word I could find for our new quarters.</p>

<p>It was a moderately calm night. We four officers lay down side by side
with just our valises to soften the ruggedness of the ground. Fitful
flashes in front showed our own guns firing; high-velocity shells,
bursting immediately <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>behind us, made us ponder on the possibility of
casualties before the night was out. But we were dog-tired, and slept
well; and by 7 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> the dog no longer snuggled against my
feet, and we were preparing for further departure.</p>

<p>"We come under the &nbsp;&mdash;th Divisional Artillery at 7.30, and have to
settle in Lieramont and await orders," explained Major Veasey. "They
don't want our Brigade to push on.... They say that the infantry could
have walked into Ep&eacute;hy without trouble, but they were too fagged. The
latest report is that the Boche is back there again."</p>

<p>Our chief aim when we walked back towards Lieramont was to secure
decent quarters before troops coming up should flood the village. Our
first discovery was a Nissen hut in a dank field on the eastern
outskirts. It wanted a good deal of tidying up, but 'twould serve. We
were ravenous for breakfast, and the cook got his wood-fire going very
quickly. There were tables and chairs to be found, and the dog and I
crossed the road, russet-red with the bricks from broken houses that
had been used to repair it, on a journey of exploration. Built close
to a high hedge was an extra large Nissen hut, painted with the Red
Cross sign. Inside twenty wire beds in tiers; dozens of rolls of
German lint and quantities of cotton-wool littered the floor. Outside,
five yards from the door, lay the body of a British officer. A brown
blanket covered all but his puttees and a pair of neat, well-made
brown boots.</p>

<p>Through an opening in the hedge we came upon more Nissen huts. One of
them was divided by a partition, and would do for a mess and for
officers' sleeping quarters. Another large building could accommodate
the men, and I found also a cook-house <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>and an office. I used chalk
freely in "staking-out" our claim, and hurried back to the major in a
fever of fear lest some one else should come before we could install
ourselves.</p>

<p>There were three incidents by which I shall remember our one night's
stay in Lieramont. First, the men's cook discovered a German officer's
silver-edged iron cross. One of the servants, a noted searcher after
unconsidered trifles, had found a Boche officer's overcoat in one of
the huts. He went through the pockets and threw the coat away. The
cook, coming after him, picked up the coat, and, "Blow me," said he,
"if this didn't fall out."</p>

<p>Also, while Major Veasey, Major Simpson, and Major Bullivant were
standing talking, a British soldier, pushing a bicycle, passed along
the road. Following him, sometimes breaking into a run to keep up,
came a plump, soft-faced German boy in infantry uniform, the youngest
German I had seen in France. "Why, he's only a kid," said Major
Veasey. "He can't be more than sixteen."</p>

<p>"Was ist ihr regiment?" called Major Bullivant. I took it that the
major was asking the youngster to what regiment he belonged.</p>

<p>The British private and his prisoner stopped. The boy Boche smiled
sheepishly, yet rather pleasantly, and said something which I didn't
understand, and don't believe Major Bullivant did either.</p>

<p>There was a half-minute pause. Then the practical British private
moved on, calling simply, "Come on, Tich!" The phrase, "He followed
like a lamb," became appropriate.</p>

<p>And I remember one further episode, not so agreeable. Major Veasey and
myself had been to call on the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>Divisional Artillery, under whose
orders we were now working. When we returned the dead British officer
still lay outside the Red Cross hut. But the neat brown boots had been
removed.</p>

<p>"By God, that's a ghoulish bit of work," said the major, angry disgust
in his face. "The man who did that is a cur."</p>

<h3>XIV. THE FIGHT FOR RONSSOY<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>Sept. 16: The first autumn tints were spreading over field and tree,
and the tempestuous rains of the last few days had chilled the air;
but the weather had righted itself now, and would prove no bar to the
next advance, which it was whispered would take place on the 18th. The
American offensive at St Mihiel on the 12th had undoubtedly keyed-up
our men, and any one supposed to know anything at all was being
button-holed for fore-casts of the extent of the Allies' giant thrust
up to the time of the winter rains.</p>

<p>There had been a four days' withdrawal of our Brigade to more peaceful
areas behind the line, and, praise the Saints! we had again come under
our own Divisional Artillery.</p>

<p>The colonel had returned, and, as usual, the first day or so after
coming off leave, appeared preoccupied and reserved. Still there was
no one like our colonel; and, in the serene atmosphere of his wise
unquestioned leadership, petty bickerings, minor personal troubles,
and the half-jesting, half-bitter railings against higher authority,
had faded away. He brought the news that the medical board in England
would not permit the C.R.A. to return to France; and the appointment
of C.R.A. had gone to the colonel of our companion Field Artillery
Brigade, now the senior Field Artillery officer <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>in the Division&mdash;a
popular honour, because, though we thought there could be no colonel
so good as ours,&mdash;we should not have been such a good Brigade had we
admitted any other belief,&mdash;we all knew Colonel &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; to be a talented
and experienced gunner, and a brave man, with great charm of manner.
Besides, it kept the appointment in the family, so to speak. We wanted
no outsider from another Division. "You must all congratulate General
&mdash;&mdash; when you meet him," said our colonel gently.</p>

<p>The four days behind the line had been interesting in their way,
despite the rain-storms. We had hot baths and slept in pyjamas once
more. Some of the younger officers and a few of the N.C.O.'s had made
a long lorry trip to Abbeville to replace worn-out clothes. Major
Bullivant and the adjutant had borrowed a car to search for almost
forgotten mess luxuries; and coming back had given a lift to a <i>cur&eacute;</i>,
who in the dark put his foot in the egg-box, smashing twenty of the
eggs. There had been the booby-trap in the blown-up dug-out. A chair
that almost asked to be taken stood half-embedded in earth near the
doorway. I was about to haul it away to the mess when I perceived a
wire beneath it, and drew back. Afterwards some sappers attached more
wire, and, from a safe distance, listened to a small explosion that
would have meant extreme danger to any one standing near. Also there
had been the dead horse that lay unpleasantly near our mess. Major
Veasey, "Swiffy," the doctor, our rollicking interpreter M. Phineas,
and myself all took turns at digging a hole for its burial; and there
was plenty of laughter, because old Phineas refused to go near the
horse without swathing his face in a scarf, and when wielding the pick
raised it full-stretch above his head before bringing it, with slow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>dignity, to earth&mdash;for all the world like a church-bell-ringer. Two
nights in succession German night-bombers had defied our anti-aircraft
guns and brought cruel death to horses camped alongside the canal. On
the second night we had witnessed a glorious revenge. Our
search-lights had concentrated upon a Gotha, and they refused to let
it escape their glare. Then suddenly from up above came the
putt-puttr-putt of machine-guns. Red and blue lights floated down; the
swift streakings of inflammatory bullets clove the cobalt sky; with
ecstasy we realised that one of our airmen was in close combat with
the invader. When the enemy 'plane crashed to earth, a blazing
holocaust, cheers burst from hundreds of tent-dwellers who had come
out to view the spectacle.</p>

<p>And now on the 16th of September we had pitched tents a mile south of
Lieramont, which we had left on the 9th, on the confines of a wood
that stretched down to a road and fringed it for three parts of a mile
to the village of Templeux la Fosse. Wilde and the adjutant had
departed in high spirits, and their best clothes, to catch the leave
train, and I was doing adjutant. Hubbard, a new officer from D
Battery, who before getting his commission had been a signalling
sergeant, filled Wilde's shoes. I had ridden into Templeux la Fosse to
conduct a polite argument with the officer of a Division newly arrived
from Palestine on the matter of watering arrangements. His point was
that his Division had reached the area first and got the pumps into
working order, and his instructions were to reserve the troughs for
the horses of his own Division. I argued that if our horses did not
water in Templeux they would have to do a seven-mile journey three
times a day to the next nearest <i>abreuvoir</i>. "And you can't claim the
exclusive use of a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>watering-point unless Corps grants special
permission," I concluded.</p>

<p>"But Corps haven't instructed you to water here," he persisted.</p>

<p>"Neither have they told us <i>not</i> to come here," I countered.</p>

<p>We parted, agreeing to refer the whole matter to Corps. Corps, I might
add, ruled that we should be allowed to water 200 horses per hour at
certain hours, and that the other Division should police the
performance.</p>

<p>I had returned in time to administer the distribution of fifty-nine
remounts come from the base to replace battery horses killed by bombs
and shell-fire, or evacuated by "Swiffy," our veterinary officer, to
the Mobile Veterinary Section, as a result of the hard-going and
watering difficulties since the advance started on August 8th.</p>

<p>I was talking to the staff captain about the ammunition dumps he had
arranged for the coming battle, when the brigade clerk handed me a
buff slip just arrived from the Casualty Clearing Station. It stated
simply that 2nd Lieut. Garstin had died as the result of gun-shot
wounds. Poor boy! a handsome well-mannered youngster, who had come out
to France practically from school.</p>

<p>I finished talking to the staff captain and walked to the colonel's
tent. I told him of Garstin's death.</p>

<p>"Wounded last night taking up ammunition, wasn't he?" said the colonel
gravely.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. He had finished the job and was coming back towards
Lieramont. Two of the men were wounded as well."</p>

<p>The colonel pulled out the note-book in which he kept his list of the
officers in the Brigade.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>"That leaves C Battery very short of officers. You'd better
transfer&mdash;let me see&mdash;M'Whirter from 'B.' ... And ask the staff
captain if we can have an officer from the D.A.C."</p>

<p>A little later I sent out the following wire to B and C Batteries:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"2nd Lieut. J. M'Whirter will be attached to C Battery on
receipt of this message. 2nd Lieut. F.E.R. Collinge of No. 1
Section D.A.C. will join B Battery to-day."</p></div>

<p>The night bristled with excitements. No. 1 Section of the D.A.C., with
two hundred horses, were camped a hundred yards from us, and at 9
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> I was in their mess, talking books of the day, horses,
and stage gossip. A lull in the conversation was broken by the low
unmistakable drone of an enemy aeroplane. It sounded right overhead.
"What's happened to our anti-aircraft people?" said Major Brown,
starting up from the table. "How's he got through as far as this
without any one shooting at him?"</p>

<p>We waited in silence. I wondered what had become of the dog, who had
followed me, but had remained outside the trench-cover mess.</p>

<p>The first bomb crashed near enough to put out the candles and rattle
the glasses on the table. "That fell over there," said the padre,
pointing to behind the wood. "No, it was on this side, not far from my
horses," put in Major Brown quickly.</p>

<p>Three more bombs shook the ground beneath us. Then we heard more
distant explosions.</p>

<p>Outside we saw torch flashings in the D.A.C. horse lines, and heard
hurrying to and fro. "Swiffy" also had run down to give his aid.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>So serious had been the loss of horses through bombing during the
summer of 1918 that after each fatal raid an official report had to be
forwarded and a formal inquiry held to decide whether full precautions
for the safety of the horses had been taken. At 9.30 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> I
received this note from Major Brown:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"The following casualties occurred to animals of this Section by
hostile bombs at 7 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> on 16th inst.&mdash;</p>

<p>"Map location D 230, c. 97: killed, 7; wounded, 11."</p></div>

<p>Half an hour later a message from C Battery, who were a mile and a
half away along the valley, informed me that their casualties in
horses and mules numbered 19.</p>

<p>At two in the morning I was aroused by a furious beating of wind and
rain upon the tent. Hubbard, already in receipt of wet on his side of
the tent, was up fastening the entrance-flap, which had torn loose.
Sharp flashes of lightning and heavy thunder accompanied the squall
when it reached its height. "I hope the pegs hold," shouted Hubbard,
and we waited while the tent-sides strained and the pole wavered. The
dog growled, and a scuffling behind us was followed by the appearance,
at the back of the tent, of the colonel's head and shoulders. In his
pyjamas, drenched and shivering with cold, he struggled inside. "My
tent's down," he called sharply. "Houston's got my kit into his
bivouac.... You two fellows hop outside and hammer in the pegs....
Let's save this tent if we can.... And some one lend me a towel for a
rub down!"</p>

<p>Wrapped in rain-coats, Hubbard and myself faced the skirling rain.
When we slipped inside again the colonel <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>had dried himself. I lent
him a blanket and my British warm, and he settled himself contentedly
on the ground, refusing to occupy either camp-bed.</p>

<p>"The annoying part," he said, with the boyish ring in his voice that
made his laugh so attractive, "is that my tent was much better put up
than yours."</p>

<p>The wind still blew when we got up in the morning. A valiant tale came
from "Swiffy," the doctor, and M. Phineas. They occupied a tent 'twixt
a bank and a hedge, nearer to the D.A.C. M. Phineas had held up the
pole with folds of wet canvas alternately choking him or whirling
round him, while "Swiffy" yelled for him to kneel upon the tent bottom
to keep it fast, and expected him to fetch a servant at the same time.
The doctor, enfolded by the wanton canvas in another state compartment
of the blown-about tent, was cut off from communication with the other
two, and fought the battle on his own.</p>

<p>The struggle to keep the tents from collapsing was crowned at 6
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> by the urgent and peremptory order from Division: "All
tents in the Divisional forward area are to be struck before dawn."</p>

<p>It was an order that breathed an understanding fear of the inquisitive
eyes of enemy aerial observers. But if the G.S.O. who issued the order
really knew&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr />

<p>Under cover of the darkness the Brigade moved up 6000 yards to secret
positions for the morrow's battle. We were behind our own infantry
once again, and it was to be a big advance. We had come over forty
miles since August 8 in a series of three-to eight-mile leaps; for the
third time the battalions had been brought up to something like
strength, and they were full of fight. In the mud and slime of the
Somme and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>Flanders in 1916 and 1917, when each advance was on a
narrow front and ceased after a one-day effort, I always marvelled at
the patient, fatalistic heroism of the infantry. A man went "over the
top" understanding that, however brilliant the attack, the exultant
glory of continuous chase of a fleeing, broken enemy would not be his;
and that, should he escape wounds or death, it would not be long
before he went "over the top" again, and yet again. But this open
fighting had changed all that. It showed results for his grit and
endurance to the humblest "infanteer." And remember, it was the
civilian soldier&mdash;unversed in war, save actual war&mdash;who accepted and
pushed home the glorious opportunities of achievement that these
wondrous days offered.</p>

<p>The colonel and I mounted our horses at eight o'clock, saw C and D
Batteries begin their march, and called upon the new C.R.A. in his
hut-headquarters at Lieramont. He was genuinely pleased at being
congratulated upon his appointment, and, I remember, produced for me a
Havana, come straight from London. Both the General and the
brigade-major had good things to say of the dog, who was now
definitely known as "Ernest"&mdash;chiefly because I had said "Hullo" to
call him so many times that inevitably one recalled Mr Frank Tinney
and his mode of addressing his stage assistant.</p>

<p>From Lieramont the colonel and myself rode eastwards two miles and a
half. The road was crowded with waggons and horses, returning in
orderly fashion from delivering ammunition. In the distance guns
boomed. When we got to the <i>pav&eacute;</i> the colonel said we would walk
across country the rest of the way. Our horses had only been gone a
couple of minutes when the colonel suddenly halted and exclaimed,
"I've let Laneridge go back with my steel helmet."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>"Should we wait a few minutes on the road, sir?" I responded quickly;
"Laneridge is likely to come back and try to catch you.... Of course
he doesn't know where our headquarters will be."</p>

<p>For answer the colonel stood in the centre of the road and shouted
with studied clearness&mdash;"Laneridge!... Laneridge!"</p>

<p>We tried a joint call, and repeated it; but there was no sound of
returning hoofs.</p>

<p>One curious result followed. An infantry soldier, who had passed us,
came back and, in a north-country accent, asked, "Beg pardon, sir, but
did you call me?&mdash;my name's Laneridge, sir."</p>

<p>"No," said the colonel, "I was calling my groom."</p>

<p>The man passed on. "That's a really striking coincidence," remarked
the colonel. "Laneridge is not a common name."</p>

<p>After waiting five minutes we continued our walk, and crossing a
valley dotted with abandoned gun-pits and shallow dug-outs, came to a
shrub-covered bank from which a battery was pulling out its guns.</p>

<p>"Our headquarters will be here," said the colonel succinctly. "Hubbard
has been sorting things out. There are dug-outs along the bank, and I
expect we shall find something in the trench down there."</p>

<p>Hubbard had indeed found a place for the mess in the trench, while he
pointed to a cubby-hole in the bank that would do for the colonel, and
to another shelter, a yard high from roof to floor, in which he and I
could lie down. The telephone lines to the batteries and to Div. Art.
were laid. He was ready for the battle.</p>

<p>Zero hour was at 5.20 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> The battery commanders had
received the operation orders during the afternoon. I reported our
arrival to the brigade-major; and not <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>worrying much about some
hostile 'planes that seemed to be dropping bombs in the neighbourhood
of the front line, we turned in.</p>

<p>At 1.30 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> the telephone near my head buzzed. I heard the
colonel say, "Are you troubled by gas?"</p>

<p>"Haven't noticed any, sir."</p>

<p>"You had better have your box-respirator ready. It seems to be coming
in a cloud down the valley."</p>

<p>I dozed off again, but half an hour later the uneasy movements of
"Ernest" roused me. I sneezed several times, and felt a burning in the
throat. This was undoubtedly gas. Hubbard I found to be a heavy
sleeper, but by punching hard enough I made him open his eyes, and we
put on our box-respirators. It was half an hour before the gas
sergeant reported that the air had cleared. We slept once more. Half
an hour before zero time the gas rattle sounded again, and indeed we
were wearing our respirators, when at 5.20 the usual sudden crackle
and rumble all along the front announced the opening of the barrage.
Judged by the quickness with which he put down a retaliatory barrage,
the enemy was prepared for our attack. Nothing could now hold
"Ernest." He dashed tirelessly north, south, east, west, towards
whichever point of the compass he heard a gun firing or a shell
exploding. "I'm sure that dog's mad," commented the colonel when we
breakfasted at 7 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> "I watched him from my dug-out for
three-quarters of an hour after the barrage started. He passed the
opening eighty times, then I got tired of counting. He seems to take a
marvellous interest in shells.... It's a pity the staff captain can't
use him for ammunition returns."</p>

<p>While we were conducting a settled defence of the line, or registering
our guns for a battle, no one visited the "O.P.'s," or the front line,
more than the colonel. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>Many and many a morning, with a couple of
sandwiches and a slab of chocolate in his pocket, he tramped to the
O.P. and stayed there until dark, criticising the shooting of the
batteries and finding fresh targets for their fire. But during a set
battle he did all his work on the telephone, in touch with Divisional
artillery one way, and with the batteries, the F.O.O.'s, and the
infantry the other. There is never much news during the first hour, or
even until the full artillery programme has been completed. By that
time the Brigade expects definite reports as to whether the infantry
have reached their objectives, and upon what new points they require
artillery assistance for consolidating positions, or for repelling
counter-attacks.</p>

<p>But on this occasion the first message reached Brigade at 5.50
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> C Battery reported that immediately the barrage opened
the Boche retaliated upon them with 5&middot;9's. They had had six killed and
ten wounded. The killed included the sergeant who so splendidly
commanded C's forward sniping-gun on that bewildering, nerve-testing
March 21st.</p>

<p>I spoke to the other batteries. D Battery, and B, who had horses handy
to move forward when the first objective was taken, had been little
troubled, but A had had their mess smashed in, and three of the
servants wounded. I rang up "Buller," who was doing liaison with the
&nbsp;&mdash;th Infantry Brigade, and he said it was understood that two
companies of the &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; had lost their way, but generally the attack
proceeded well.</p>

<p>The uncertainty lasted until 11 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>, when the colonel
completed a telephone conversation with the brigade-major. The
Division on our left had not gained its first objective because of
exceedingly stout opposition on the part of a German corps, who had
gained a fine <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>fighting reputation during the past two weeks. The &nbsp;&mdash;th
south of our Division had done very well, capturing and advancing
beyond the village of Templeux le Guerard. Our Divisional infantry had
cleared Ronssoy after tough fighting, but their farther progress was
checked because of the hold-up on the left. Reserve battalions of the
Division chiefly affected by this resistance were to attack as soon as
possible.</p>

<p>"The Australians have done extraordinarily well down south," the
colonel told me. "They simply marched through with their tanks,
capturing guns and prisoners wholesale, and are on their most distant
objective."</p>

<p>Then he rang up Major Simpson. "Don't take your battery forward until
you get definite orders from the Brigade," he said. "The enemy still
hold the high ground north of us."</p>

<p>Major Bullivant, always keen on making an early reconnaissance during
a set battle, rang up at noon to say that he had been as far as a high
wood, a mile and a half in front of his battery. "I got a very long
view from there," he went on, "and saw no sign at all of any
Boche...."</p>

<p>The colonel, putting on his pince-nez, studied his map and asked the
major for the exact position. "Yes," he observed, "that's on the 140
contour, and you must have seen as far as &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; copse."</p>

<p>His next remark revealed how his mind was working. "Did you notice any
tracks from the wood towards the batteries?... Two tracks!... but my
map shows a line of barbed wire running across.... Good! ... there is
a useable track as far as 19 c, and by striking east before you come
to the cross tracks it is possible to find an opening in the wire....
Good, Bullivant.... I expect I shall move the batteries that way....
No, no orders to move yet!"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>At 1.15 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>, after further talks with the brigade-major, the
colonel told me to send out this message to the four batteries:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"Brigade will advance as soon as possible to position in F 20,
or if that locality is full up, in F 21 c. Prepare to advance,
and report to Brigade commander at F 20 c 4, 2."</p></div>

<p>The colonel's horses had been ordered up from the waggon line.
"Hubbard and I will go on," he told me, "and Hubbard can commence
laying out lines to the batteries' new positions. You will remain here
to keep in touch with Division. I shall be back before we move, and
batteries are not to go forward until orders are issued from here."</p>

<p>He returned at 4 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> and told me to send out orders for an
immediate advance to the positions chosen. I was returning from the
signallers' dug-out when a young major belonging to the &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;s passed,
followed by a sergeant. The major looked pale and worn, but walked
quickly. There are moments when personal acquaintance with members of
other branches of the Service possesses a very direct value. I did not
know Major &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; very well, but a habit contracted through frequent
visits to the Infantry made me call out "Any news?"</p>

<p>"Our Brigade's doing a clearing-up attack at five o'clock," he
answered without stopping.</p>

<p>"We don't know anything about that," I said, catching him up. "How
long is it since orders were issued?"</p>

<p>"I've only just left the General," he replied, still walking ahead.</p>

<p>"Can you spare two minutes to explain the scheme <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>to the colonel," I
pressed. "Our batteries are just about to move up."</p>

<p>"I hardly have time to get to the battalion," he answered with a frown
of dissent.</p>

<p>"Two minutes!" I pleaded&mdash;and succeeded. We hurried to the mess. There
was a quick, clear exchange of words between the major and the
colonel. The major sped away as the colonel thanked him. "Telephone at
once to the batteries to prevent them moving!" said the colonel,
turning to me.</p>

<p>Before five minutes had passed, the colonel, after a telephone talk
with the brigadier-general, had arranged a short barrage programme for
the batteries.</p>

<p>"There's usefulness in your being a gossip, you see," he smiled, a
quarter of an hour later.</p>

<p>The orders for the batteries to advance still held good, and
immediately the barrage ceased they pulled out. By 6 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> the
colonel had ridden forward again. My instructions were to remain until
the divisional signalling officer had laid a line to the new Brigade
Headquarters. At eight o'clock, followed by "Ernest" and the Brigade
signallers who had stayed with me, I rode through St Emilie and dipped
into a cul-de-sac valley crowded with the field batteries of another
Division. Our way took us toward and across gorse-clad, wild-looking
uplands. Night approached. Just as we halted at a spot where two
puddly, churned-up sunken roads crossed, guns behind and on either
side of us belched forth flame and rasping sound. Eighteen-pounder
shells screamed swiftly over us; the whole countryside spurted
flashes. One of the horses plunged with nervousness. "It's an S.O.S.
call, sir," said a driver who had put his horse under a bank, raising
his voice against the din. "Ernest," his little body <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>quivering with
excitement, was already racing backwards and forwards. I told my groom
to take my horse into the sunken road, and started to look for the
colonel and the headquarters party. A sticky walk up the track to the
left took me within a couple of hundred yards of the village of
Ronssoy, where most of the Boche shells were falling. No signs of
Headquarters up there. After a lot of shouting to persuade the dog to
keep near me, I turned back and went through the mud again, past the
cross-roads junction, and along a still slimier, water-logged
cart-track. I found every one on Headquarters digging shelters in the
side of the road. The servants had rigged up a corrugated-iron
habitation for the colonel. The brigade clerks, the signallers, and
the cooks had dug hard, and made use of trench-covers, with the swift
resource that long experience of trench-life had developed into a kind
of second nature. Hubbard had arranged an "elephant," raised on two
rows of ancient sandbags, for himself and me to snuggle under.</p>

<p>"I've sent out S.O.S. lines to the batteries," said the colonel, who
was sitting on a box in a long-disused gun-pit. "We'll turn this place
into a mess to-morrow."</p>

<p>The firing died down. I sent some one to tell the groom to take the
horses back to the waggon line which was being established at the
headquarters position we had just left. The cook prepared us a simple
meal. By 10 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> the brigade-major had telephoned
instructions for the night-firing with which the batteries were to
busy themselves. Our night was disturbed by the swish-plop of gas
shells, but none came near enough seriously to disquiet us.</p>

<h3>XV. "ERNEST" IS LOST<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>Sept. 19: That morning Bob Pottinger reported at Brigade Headquarters,
smiling all over his face. An extra leave warrant had come in, and it
was his turn to go. For weeks past every one had known of his
eagerness to get home, in order to conduct certain matrimonial
projects to the "Yes or No" stage. Leave to England was going nicely
now. Dumble, young Beale, Judd, and Hetherington were away, and the
men were going at the rate of five per day. Officers had to be five
months in France since their last leave&mdash;mostly it ran to seven; the
men's qualification was twelve months. Happy is the army that is
attacking! Only when the enemy has full possession of the initiative
is leave entirely cut off.</p>

<p>Of the 5 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> attack carried out the night before by the &nbsp;&mdash;th
Brigade, all that we knew was that unexpectedly large numbers of the
enemy had been met. The fighting had been fierce, and the Boche still
held some of the ground the Brigade had set out to take. Right through
the night our guns had been busy firing protective bursts.</p>

<p>The mystery of the Boche's unlooked-for strength was explained by a
Divisional wire that reached us about 8 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> It stated that a
prisoner captured by the &nbsp;&mdash;th Brigade said that at 7 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> on
the 18th, following <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>urgent orders resulting from the British
offensive at 5.20, a whole Boche division came by bus from Maretz,
fourteen miles back. Their mission was to make a counter-attack that
would win back the original line. They deployed at Bony, near the
canal, and completed their march in readiness for an attack at 6
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> But the 5 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> thrust by our &nbsp;&mdash;th Brigade
completely surprised them, and in fact broke up their offensive. The
prisoner also reported that many casualties had been caused by our
artillery fire.</p>

<p>The brigade-major, telephoning at 9 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>, told us further
details about the main offensive of the day before. The hold-up on our
left had continued until late in the evening, in spite of renewed
attacks on a big scale. "The German Alpine Corps have some of the
stiffest fighters we have run against for a long time," he went on.
"On the outskirts of Ep&eacute;hy one post was held by three officers and
forty-five men until 7.45 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> When they surrendered there
were only seventeen not wounded."</p>

<p>The sunken road we were occupying led towards the red-brick,
modern-looking village of Templeux-le-Guerard. A German encampment,
quite a large one, containing several roomy huts newly built and well
fitted up, stood outside the eastern edge of the village. The colonel
had just pointed out that any amount of material for the improvement
of our Headquarters was to be had for the fetching, and I had
despatched the wheeler and a party of servants and signallers to the
German encampment when the telephone bell rang.</p>

<p>It was the brigade-major again. "We're doing another attack," he said
cheerfully, "to finish the work started last evening.... I want you to
open on line F 10 c 2.0 to F 16 b 0.8.... Dwell there till 11.20....
Then creep 1100 yards in a north-easterly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>direction&mdash;100 yards each
four minutes&mdash;to F 11 a 4.0 to F 11 d 2.5.... Dwell twenty minutes....
Then creep 100 yards each four minutes to F 11 b 1.3 to F 11 d 8.7....
4&middot;5 hows. on Sart Farm.... Open at Rapid Rate on start-line for first
four minutes.... Then go to Normal Rate for the creep, and Slow on
final protective barrage.... Is that clear?... Right!... Good-bye."</p>

<p>I had repeated the map co-ordinates as the brigade-major gave them,
and had written them down; and the colonel, coming in to the mess,
followed the telephone conversation on his map. I handed him my
note-book, and for five minutes he worked in his rapid silent way,
with his ivory pocket-rule and scale for measuring map co-ordinates.
Then he told the telephonist on duty to get him each battery in turn;
and the Brigade was soon a stage nearer in its preparations for
supporting the Infantry brigade selected to make the attack.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the brigade-major again rang up to say that the how.
battery was required to fire smoke-shells on certain points.</p>

<p>Before the fight began the colonel made a tour of the batteries. The
party sent to the German camp returned with forms and tables, and
plenty of corrugated iron and boards; and it was while I was detailing
a party of them to dig a sleeping-place for the colonel farther into
the bank that a group of officers, headed by a red-tabbed staff
captain, came along. Even if I had not recognised him from his
portraits&mdash;or because two winters before the war he and I stayed in
the same hotel at Nice&mdash;there was no doubt as to his identity. Name
and title appeared written in indelible pencil on his box-respirator.
He told me he was looking for a headquarters for his brigade, and he
had heard that the sunken road was a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>likely spot. "I don't know how
long we shall be here," I replied, "but we intend to carry out as many
improvements as possible. It will be a decent place to take over when
we leave." And I indicated the digging party. "Ernest," as usual, was
extremely affable, and received any amount of petting and patting from
the visiting officers. Just as they departed the assistant brigade
clerk came to me with a batch of men's leave warrants. I went into the
mess, and was occupied signing the warrants and other documents for
ten minutes or so. When I came out there was no sign of "Ernest." Ten
minutes later the attack started and the air was fluttered with the
swish and scream of shells.</p>

<p>An hour passed. The colonel returned. We lunched. Afterwards the
colonel removed his jacket, did a bit of sawing, and directed the
wheeler and his party in the task of boarding-in our gun-pit mess, so
as to leave it no longer exposed to wind and rain on two sides.
Hubbard, who was proud of his strength, climbed on top and pulled and
shifted the three six-inch girders to more suitable positions. I took
a turn with pick and shovel in the improvement of the colonel's
dug-out. The dog had not come back. One of the orderlies thought he
had seen him running along with the officers who had called before
lunch.</p>

<p>About half-past three the brigade-major called for our 18-pounders to
drive off another Boche wave with a half-hour's shower of shrapnel; he
also wanted our how. battery to devote itself to Sart Farm and Holland
Post, which forward observers reported to be little strongholds of
enemy trench-mortars and machine-guns. Still no sign of "Ernest." The
mess-cart arrived at five o'clock, and as a last resource I scribbled
a note to the doctor, who was as fond of the dog as any of us,
describing the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>titled staff captain, and urging him to scour the
countryside until he struck a trail that would lead to "Ernest's"
recovery.</p>

<p>At 7.30 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> an S.O.S. call, telephoned by Drysdale, who was
doing liaison with the &nbsp;&mdash;th Infantry Brigade, showed how desperately
the Boche was contesting the occupation of the strong points on this
portion of the front, although a Corps Intelligence Summary, delivered
about the same time, told us that 60 officers and 2315 other ranks,
wounded and unwounded, had passed through the Corps prisoners of war
cages since 6 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> the day before, and that the strength of
the average Hun infantry company had been reduced to 60 rifles.</p>

<p>As the colonel, Hubbard, and myself sat down to dinner, the following
message was handed to me:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"Wire has been laid out to O.P. at F 16 c 42 by B and C
Batteries. The contours on the small paper 1/20,000 map are not
correct in this neighbourhood. New zero line was registered on
Tombois Farm."</p></div>

<p>"Yes, I've already warned the batteries that the special maps are not
reliable," commented the colonel.</p>

<p>The end of the day found our infantry in possession of most of the
strong points they had striven to seize, but at a heavy cost. And all
through the night our batteries poured forth fierce deadly fire to
harass and nullify Hun efforts to loosen our grip.</p>

<p>It was the same sort of warfare next day. The fighting was carried out
yard by yard. There was a certain post, Doleful Post, very valuable to
the Boche because it dominated the immediate neighbourhood. It was our
batteries' business to make it hellishly uncomfortable for him. At 10
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> the colonel, after a talk <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>with Division, ordered the
Brigade to bring harassing fire to bear during the next twenty-four
hours upon Doleful Post and the valley running north-east from it. The
three 18-pdr. batteries were to work in two-hour shifts, firing 50
rounds an hour; the 4&middot;5 how. battery was to fire 15 rounds per hour
continuously. Next day the infantry were to storm the post, and thus
secure a jumping-off spot for another forward leap.</p>

<p>With a more or less settled programme laid down&mdash;for twenty-four hours
at any rate&mdash;the colonel, Hubbard, and I devoted some thought to the
building of our headquarters. "It looks as if we were in for a spell
of trench warfare without the protection we were accustomed to in
trench-warfare days," observed the colonel. "There are no mined
dug-outs to hide in." The cook, a Scottish miner, had contrived a kind
of two-storied habitation in his little stretch of the bank; and he
and Manning and my servant felt themselves moderately safe. The
colonel's home&mdash;heavy "elephant" roof and wooden walls stuffed well
into the bank&mdash;being complete, the wheeler, the servants, Hubbard, and
myself put backs and forearms into the task of fashioning a similar
shelter for Hubbard and me. I, of course, could not stray far from the
telephone. The staff captain wanted to talk about new ammunition dumps
and gun-repairing workshops. Major Bullivant inquired whether he
couldn't be selected for the next gunnery course at Shoeburyness.
Major Veasey thought it time another captain relieved Drysdale as
liaison officer with the Infantry Brigade. And all the time there were
routine papers and returns to be looked through and signed.</p>

<p>"There's something that will do for the September War Diary," said the
colonel, putting in front of me <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>a letter sent to him by the
brigadier-general commanding one of our Infantry brigades. It ran:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"I am anxious that you and your officers and men should know how
grateful I and my battalion commanders are to you for the
excellent barrage you gave us yesterday morning (Sept. 18) under
such very difficult circumstances. They all realise that with
the moving of batteries, getting up the ammunition, and the
frequent barrages you are called upon to provide, besides the
harassing and the normal shooting, a very great strain is placed
on your Brigade. And the success we had yesterday was largely
made possible by the splendid work of your people."</p></div>

<p>About eleven o'clock the doctor, who had ridden from the waggon line,
came in gaily singing "Hail! hail! the gang's all here," to a tune
from the "Pirates of Penzance." "I've located 'Ernest,'" he shouted
triumphantly when he saw me.</p>

<p>"Splendid," I answered, smiling in return. "Have you got him at the
waggon line?"</p>

<p>"No; I saw him as I was coming up here. He was trotting along with a
captain who was going towards that village with the factory, over
there."</p>

<p>"Was he a staff captain, with a Military Cross and another ribbon?" I
asked.... "Didn't you tell him it was our dog?"</p>

<p>"That's so. I told him that, and 'Ernest' came and jumped around when
he saw me; but the captain said it couldn't be our dog, because a
brigadier-general's name was on the collar, and he wasn't going to let
him go; his colonel wanted him. Besides," added the doctor
plaintively, "'Ernest' wouldn't follow me."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>"His colonel!" I repeated, puzzled. "Didn't he say 'his General'? A
staff captain is on a brigadier-general's staff.... His colonel?...
Are you sure he was a staff captain? Was he wearing red?"</p>

<p>"I didn't see any red," replied the doctor. "He was walking behind a
waggon that had a pile of wood and iron on it. It looked as if they
were moving."</p>

<p>My face fell. "Did you notice his regiment? Was he a gunner or an
infantryman, or what?" I asked quickly.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't say that I did. I don't know all your regiments."</p>

<p>The colonel joined us. "Laneridge has brought my mare up," he remarked
pleasantly. "You'd like a little exercise, perhaps. When the doctor
has finished his sick parade you take my mare and see if the dog can
be found."</p>

<p>The doctor and I rode across country, and scoured the village he had
pointed to, but there was no trace of "Ernest." We spoke to a couple
of military policemen, told them all about our loss, saw that they
inscribed particulars in their note-books, and then continued our
inquiries among some heavy gunners, who had pulled into a garden near
the sugar factory. I even narrated the story to an Irish A.P.M., who
was standing in the street conversing with a motoring staff officer.
"I've been in this village fully an hour and haven't seen a dog such
as you describe," said the A.P.M. "And I'm sure I should have noticed
him.... I'm fond of dogs, and I notice them all.... I'll help you any
way I can.... Give me full particulars, and I'll pass them round to my
police."</p>

<p>He listened while I tried to obtain further clues from the doctor as
to the branch of the service to which the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>captain, seen that morning
with "Ernest," belonged. The doctor, his cap tilted backwards, a long
dark cigar protruding at an angle of 45 degrees from the corner of his
mouth, did his best, but it was no good. "I'm sorry&mdash;I don't know your
regiments well enough," he said at last.</p>

<p>It was at this point that the doctor's groom&mdash;in the building trade
before the war&mdash;entered into the conversation. He had heard everything
that had been said since the quest began, but this was the first
remark he had made.</p>

<p>"The officer the medical officer spoke to this morning, sir, was in
the &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; Pioneers," he said to me.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell us that before?" asked the doctor impatiently.</p>

<p>"Sorry, sir, you didn't ask me," was the toneless reply.</p>

<p>The doctor looked unutterable things, and the lighted end of his cigar
described three or four irregular circles. "Gosh!" he pronounced
briskly. "We gotta put more pep into looking for this dog, or the
war'll end before we find him."</p>

<p>A high-velocity shell bursting on the near side of the factory helped
to decide us. The A.P.M. said that a party of the Pioneers had marched
down the street half an hour ago. The doctor and I bade him good-bye,
went through the village, and were directed to a lane alongside a
railway embankment. In one among a row of wooden huts, where the
Headquarters of the reserve infantry brigade were quartered, we found
the colonel of the Pioneers finishing lunch. He and our colonel were
old friends, and immediately I explained the object of my visit he
became sympathetic. "Yes," he laughed, "we have your dog&mdash;at <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>least
our A Company have him. I believe they found him wandering on the
other side of the valley.... Stop and have some lunch, and I'll send
for him."</p>

<p>"No, thank you, sir.... I shall have to be getting back."</p>

<p>A subaltern went off to fetch the dog. The doctor left to pick up the
horses and to return to the waggon line. The colonel invited me to
have a drink. But there was disappointment when the subaltern
returned. "I'm afraid the dog has gone again, sir&mdash;about half an hour
ago."</p>

<p>"Really!" said the colonel.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; he was in A Company's mess when two Gunner officers passed,
and he went after them."</p>

<p>"He knows your badge, at any rate," remarked the colonel to me with
twinkling eyes. "I'm sorry you've had your journey for nothing. But
we'll keep a look-out and send him back if he returns to us."</p>

<p>"I'm going to have another search round the village before I go back,
sir," I responded determinedly. "We're getting warmer."</p>

<p>Turning from the lane into the road that led into the village, I
noticed a groom who had been waiting with his two horses since the
first time I passed the spot. At first he thought he hadn't seen a dog
that looked like a cross between an Airedale and a Belgian sheep-dog.
Then he fancied he had. Yes, he believed it had passed that way with
an R.A.M.C. major. "But those men near that ambulance car will tell
you, sir. They were playing with the dog I saw, about half an hour
ago."</p>

<p>Yes, I was really on the trail now. "That's right, sir," remarked the
R.A.M.C. sergeant when he had helped two walking wounded into the
ambulance car. "I <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>remember the dog, and saw the name on the
collar.... He followed our major about twenty minutes ago. He's gone
across that valley to Brigade Headquarters.... I don't think he'll be
long."</p>

<p>"What's it like up there?" asked one of the ambulance men of a slight,
fagged-looking lance-corporal of the Fusiliers, who had been hit in
the shoulder.</p>

<p>"Hot!" replied the Fusilier. "One dropped near Battalion Headquarters
and killed our sergeant.... I think there are five more of our lot
coming along."</p>

<p>There were two more places to be filled before the ambulance car moved
off. Another Fusilier, wounded in the knee, hobbled up, assisted by
two men of the same regiment, one of them with his head bandaged.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Jim!" called the lance-corporal from the ambulance. "I
wondered if you'd come along too. Did you see Tom?"</p>

<p>"No," responded the man hit in the ankle.</p>

<p>The ambulance moved off. An empty one took its place. It was a quarter
to two, but I was resolved to wait now until the R.A.M.C. major
returned. Three shells came over and dropped near the railway. More
walking wounded filled places in the ambulance.</p>

<p>The major, with "Ernest" at his heels, came back at a quarter-past
two. "Ernest" certainly knew me again. He leapt up and licked my hand,
and looked up while the major listened to my story. "Well, I should
have kept him&mdash;or tried to do so," he said. "He's a taking little
fellow, and I've always had a dog until a few weeks ago.... But"&mdash;with
a pleasant smile&mdash;"I think you've earned your right to him.... I've
never seen a dog so excited by shells.... Well, good-bye!"</p>

<p>He walked away, and "Ernest" started after him. I stood still in the
centre of the road. The dog turned <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>his head as if to see whether I
meant to follow. Then he came back, and quietly lay down at my feet.</p>

<p>We had a joyous walk home. There were shells to scamper after, wire to
scramble through, old trenches to explore. The return of "Ernest"
brought a deep content to our mess.</p>

<hr />

<p>Sept. 21: The attack which started at 5.40 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> was carried
out by two of our Divisional Infantry brigades; a brigade of another
Division attacked simultaneously. The object was to close with the
main enemy positions in the Hindenburg Line. Tanks were put in to
break down the opposition&mdash;sure to be met by the brigades on the left
and right; and every officer in the Division knew that if the final
objectives could be held the Boche would be compelled to withdraw
large forces to the far side of the canal. The attack was planned with
extraordinary attention to detail. Battalions were ordered not to
attempt to push on beyond the final objective; trench mortars were to
be moved up to cover the consolidation of the final positions; the
reconnaissance work had been specially thorough. Our batteries had
horses and limbers in readiness for a quick rushing up of the guns.</p>

<p>The earlier part of the operation went well enough, but by 8
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> we knew that our two Infantry brigades were having to go
all out. The Boche machine-gunners were firing with exemplary coolness
and precision. At 8.30 the brigade-major telephoned that every gun we
possessed must fire bursts on certain hostile battery positions. The
colonel and I didn't leave the mess that morning; the telephone was
rarely out of use. At half-past ten Major Bartlett, who had gone
forward to an infantry post to see what was happening, got a message
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>back to say that, harassed by heavy machine-gun and rifle fire, our
infantry were coming back. Aeroplane calls for artillery fire on
hostile batteries were twice responded to by our batteries. Drysdale,
doing liaison with the &nbsp;&mdash;rd Infantry Brigade, reported that two
battalions had had severe losses. A buff slip from the Casualty
Clearing Station informed us that the lead driver of our brigade
telephone cart had died in hospital overnight: he had been hit just
after leaving the Headquarters position the previous evening, and was
the second Headquarters driver to be killed since Sept. 1. The only
relief during a morning of excitement and some gloom was the arrival
of three big cigars, sent by the doctor for the colonel, Hubbard, and
myself. As the colonel didn't smoke cigars, the only solution was for
Hubbard and myself to toss for the remaining one. Hubbard won.</p>

<p>At one o'clock it became clear that our infantry could not hope to do
more than consolidate upon their first objective. There was no
prospect of the batteries moving forward, and at 1.30 the colonel told
me to send out this message to all batteries&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"Gun limbers and firing battery waggons need not be kept within
2000 yards of gun positions any longer to-day."</p></div>

<p>Major Veasey called on us at tea-time, and the talk ran on the
possibilities of the next few days' fighting. "The Boche seems bent on
holding out here as long as he can," said the major. "I think he's
fighting a rear-guard action on a very big scale," said the colonel
thoughtfully. "Our air reports indicate much movement in his back
areas.... And most of his artillery fire is from long range now."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>"Let's hope it continues in that way," went on the major, filling his
pipe. "If only he'd stop his beastly gas shells it wouldn't be so bad.
It's not clean war. I'd vote willingly for an armistice on gas
shells."</p>

<p>"Are you improving your accommodation at the battery?" asked the
colonel. "We're likely to be here a few days, and we must make as much
protection as we can."</p>

<p>"We've got quite a decent dug-out in the bank to sleep in," answered
Major Veasey, getting up to go, "but our mess is rather in the
open&mdash;under a tarpaulin. However, it's quite a pleasant mess.
Bullivant and Simpson came to dine last night, and we played bridge
till eleven."</p>

<p>I had sent out the S.O.S. lines to batteries, and we had sat down to
dinner a little earlier than usual, owing to the desirability of
showing as little light as possible, when the telephone bell rang. I
put the receiver to my ear.</p>

<p>A strong decided voice spoke. "Is that the adjutant, sir?... I'm
Sergeant &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; of D Battery, sir.... Major Veasey has been badly
wounded."</p>

<p>"Major Veasey wounded," I repeated, and the colonel and Hubbard put
down knives and forks and listened.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, ... a gas shell came into the mess. Mr Kelly and Mr Wood
have been wounded as well.... We've got them away to the hospital,
sir.... Mr Kelly got it in the face, sir.... I'm afraid he's blinded."</p>

<p>"How was Major Veasey wounded?"</p>

<p>"In the arm and foot, sir.... Mr Wood was not so bad."</p>

<p>"There's no other officer at D Battery, sir," I said to the colonel,
who was already turning up the list of officers in his note-book.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>"Tell him that the senior sergeant will take command until an officer
arrives," replied the colonel promptly, "and then get on to Drysdale
at the infantry. I'll speak to him.... I don't like the idea of Veasey
being wounded by a gas shell," he added quickly. Depression descended
upon all three of us.</p>

<p>The colonel told Captain Drysdale to inform the Infantry brigadier
what had happened, and to obtain his immediate permission to go to the
battery, about half a mile away. "You've got a subaltern at the waggon
line.... Get him up," advised the colonel, "the sergeant-major can
carry on there.... Tell the General that another officer will arrive
as soon as possible to do liaison."</p>

<p>The colonel looked again at his note-book. "We're frightfully down in
officers," he said at last. "I'll ask Colonel &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp; of the &nbsp;&mdash;rd if he
can spare some one to take on to-night."</p>

<p>"I hope Veasey and Kelly are not badly wounded," he said later,
lighting a cigarette. "And I'm glad it didn't come last night, when
there were three battery commanders at the bridge party. That would
have been catastrophe."</p>

<p>That night the Boche rained gas shells all round our quarters in the
sunken road. Hubbard and myself and "Ernest" were not allowed much
sleep in our right little, tight little hut. One shell dropped within
twenty yards of us; thrice fairly heavy shell splinters played an
unnerving tattoo upon our thick iron roof; once we were forced to wear
our box-respirators for half an hour.</p>

<p>At 11.30 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> the colonel telephoned from his hut to ours to
tell me that new orders had come in from the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>brigade-major. "We are
putting down a barrage from midnight till 12.15 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>," he
said. "You needn't worry. I've sent out orders to the batteries....
Our infantry are making an assault at 12.15 on Doleful Post. It ought
to startle the Hun. He won't expect anything at that hour."</p>

<br />

<h3>XVI. THE DECISIVE DAYS<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>Sept. 22: It was as the colonel expected. The Boche took our hurricane
bombardment from midnight to 12.15 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> to be an unusually
intense burst of night-firing; and when our guns "lifted" some six
hundred yards, our infantry swept forward, and in a few minutes
captured two posts over which many lives had been unavailingly
expended during the two preceding days. Sixty prisoners also were
added to their bag.</p>

<p>But the enemy was only surprised&mdash;not done with. This was ground that
had been a leaping-off place for his mighty rush in March 1918. Close
behind lay country that had not been trod by Allied troops since the
1914 invasion. He counter-attacked fiercely, and at 5.10 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span>
a signaller roused me with the message.</p>

<p>"Our attack succeeded in capturing Duncan and Doleful Posts, but
failed on the rest of the front. S.O.S. line will be brought back to
the line it was on after 12 midnight. Bursts of harassing fire will be
put down on the S.O.S. lines and on approaches in rear from now
onwards. About three bursts per hour. Heavy artillery is asked to
conform."</p>

<p>I telephoned to the batteries to alter their S.O.S. lines, and told
the colonel what had been done. Then I sought sleep again.</p>

<p>After breakfast the brigade-major telephoned that the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>Division
immediately north of us was about to attempt the capture of a strong
point that had become a wasps' nest of machine-gunners. "We have to
hold Duncan Post and Doleful Post at all costs," he added. All through
the morning messages from Division artillery and from the liaison
officer told the same tale: fierce sallies and desperate
counter-attacks between small parties of the opposing infantry, who in
places held trench slits and rough earthworks within a mashie shot of
each other. About noon the Germans loosed off a terrible burst of fire
on a 500-yards' front. "Every Boche gun for miles round seemed to be
pulverising that awful bit," "Buller," who had gone forward to
observe, told me afterwards. "My two telephonists hid behind a brick
wall that received two direct hits, and I lay for a quarter of an hour
in a shell-hole without daring to move. Then half a dozen of their
aeroplanes came over in close formation and tried to find our infantry
with their machine-guns.... I got the wind up properly." Our batteries
answered three S.O.S. calls between 10 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> and 1 o'clock;
and, simultaneously with a news message from Division stating that
British cavalry had reached Nazareth and crossed the Jordan, that
18,000 prisoners and 160 guns had been captured, and that Liman von
Sanders had escaped by the skin of his teeth, came a report from young
Beale that Germans could be seen massing for a big effort.</p>

<p>I passed this information to the brigade-major, and our guns, and the
heavies behind them, fired harder than ever. Then for an hour until 3
o'clock we got a respite. A couple of pioneers, lent to us by the
colonel, who had shown himself so sympathetic in the matter of the
lost dog, worked stolidly with plane and saw and foot-rule, improving
our gun-pit mess by more expert carpentering <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>than we could hope to
possess. The colonel tore the wrapper of the latest copy of an
automobile journal, posted to him weekly, and devoted himself to an
article on spring-loaded starters. I read a type-written document from
the staff captain that related to the collection, "as opportunity
offers," of two field guns captured from the enemy two days before.</p>

<p>But at 3.35 the situation became electric again. The clear
high-pitched voice of young Beale sounded over the line that by a
miracle had not yet been smashed by shell-fire. "Germans in large
numbers are coming over the ridge south of Tombois Farm," he said.</p>

<p>I got through to the brigade-major, and he instructed me to order our
guns to search back 1000 yards from that portion of our front.</p>

<p>"Don't tell the batteries to 'search back,'" broke in the colonel, who
had heard me telephoning. "It's a confusing expression. Tell them to
'search east,' or 'north-east' in this case."</p>

<p>By a quarter to four the telephone wires were buzzing feverishly. More
S.O.S. rockets had gone up. The enemy had launched a very heavy
counter-attack. Our over-worked gunners left their tea, and tons of
metal screamed through the air. Within an hour Drysdale sent us most
inspiring news.</p>

<p>"The infantry are awfully pleased with our S.O.S. barrage," he said
briskly. "As a matter of fact, that burst you ordered at 3.40 was more
useful still, ... caught the Germans as they came out to attack....
They were stopped about 150 yards from our line.... They had to go
back through our barrage.... It was a great sight.... The dead can be
seen in heaps.... Over twenty Boche ran through our barrage and gave
themselves up."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>Drysdale had more good news for us twenty minutes later. Two companies
of a battalion not attacked&mdash;they were to the right of the place to
which the enemy advanced&mdash;saw what was happening, dashed forward along
a winding communication trench, and seized a position that hitherto
they had found impregnable. They got a hundred prisoners out of the
affair.</p>

<p>Two more S.O.S. calls went up before dinner-time, but a day of
tremendous heavy fighting ended with our men in glorious possession of
some of the hardest-won ground in the history of the Division.</p>

<p>"If we can hold on where we are until really fresh troops relieve us
we shall be over the Hindenburg Line in three days," said the colonel
happily, as he selected targets for the night-firing programme.</p>

<p>He had written "From receipt of this message S.O.S. lines will be as
follows&mdash;" when he stopped. "Can't we shorten this preliminary
verbiage?" he asked quizzically. "Castle made this opening phrase a
sort of tradition when he was adjutant."</p>

<p>"What about 'Henceforth S.O.S. lines will be'?" I replied, tilting my
wooden stool backwards.</p>

<p>"That will do!" said the colonel.</p>

<p>And "henceforth" it became after that.</p>

<p>For two more days we carried on this most tiring of all kinds of
fighting: for the infantry, hourly scraps with a watchful plucky foe;
for the gunners, perpetual readiness to fire protective bursts should
the enemy suddenly seek to shake our grip on this most fateful stretch
of front; in addition to day and night programmes of "crashes" that
allowed the gun detachments no rest, and at the same time demanded
unceasing care in "laying" and loading and firing the guns. And with
the opposing infantry so close to each other, and the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>front line
changing backwards and forwards from hour to hour, absolute accuracy
was never more necessary. The Brigade had had no proper rest since the
early days of August. The men had been given no opportunity for baths
or change of clothing. Our casualties had not been heavy, but they
were draining us steadily, and reinforcements stepped into this
strenuous hectic fighting with no chance of the training and testing
under actual war conditions that make a period of quiet warfare so
valuable. And yet it was this portion of "the fifty days," this
exhausting, remorseless, unyielding struggling that really led to the
Boche's final downfall. It forced him to abandon the Hindenburg
Line&mdash;the beginning of the very end.</p>

<p>I was going to write that it was astonishing how uncomplainingly, how
placidly each one of us went on with his ordinary routine duties
during this time. But, after all, it wasn't astonishing. The moments
were too occupied for weariness of soul; our minds rioted with the
thought, "He's getting done! Let's get on with it! Let's finish him."
And if at times one reflected on the barrenness, the wastefulness of
war, there still remained the satisfying of the instinct to do one's
work well. The pioneers had done their very best, and made quite a
house of our mess, even finding glass to put in the windows. I don't
know that the old wheeler understood me when I emphasised this
thoroughness of the pioneers by adding, "You see, we British always
build for posterity"; but before we went away he began to take a pride
in keeping those windows clean.</p>

<p>On Sept. 25 we heard without much pleasure that we had come under
another Divisional Artillery, and were to retire to our waggon lines
by nightfall. "I'd rather stay here a few days longer and then go out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>for a proper rest," said the colonel, taking appreciative stock of the
habitations that had arisen since our occupation. "I'm afraid this
order means a shift to another part of the line." And it was so. Our
Brigade was to side-step north, and the colonel and the battery
commanders went off after lunch to reconnoitre positions. An
Australian Field Artillery brigade came to "take-over" from us, and I
yarned with their colonel and adjutant and intelligence officer while
waiting for our colonel to return. I told them that it was ages since
I had seen a 'Sydney Bulletin.'</p>

<p>"I used to get mine regularly," said their adjutant, "but it hasn't
come for ten weeks now. I expect some skrim-shanker at the post-office
or at the base is pinching it.... I'm going to tell my people to wrap
it up in the 'War Cry' before posting it. I know one chap who's had
that done for over a year. No one thinks of pinching it then."</p>

<p>One of the Australian batteries was late getting in, and it was
half-past seven before the colonel and I, waiting for the relief to be
complete, got away. The Boche guns had been quiet all the afternoon.
But&mdash;how often it happens when one has been delayed!&mdash;shells fell
about the track we intended to take when we mounted our horses, and we
had to side-track to be out of danger. When we arrived at Headquarters
waggon lines it was too late to dine in daylight; and as Hun bombers
were on the war-path, our dinner was a blind-man's-buff affair.</p>

<p>The colonel had been told that we should be required to fight a battle
at our new positions on the 27th, and already the batteries had
commenced to take up ammunition. But when&mdash;the Hun aeroplanes having
passed by and candles being permissible in our <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>tents&mdash;the brigade
clerk produced an order requiring us to have two guns per battery in
action that very night, I considered joylessly the prospect of a long
move in the dark.</p>

<p>"They expect us to move up to-night, sir," I told the colonel, handing
him the order brought by a motor-cyclist despatch-bearer about eight
o'clock.</p>

<p>"Oh!" said the colonel&mdash;and the "Oh!" was a <i>chef-d'&oelig;uvre</i> of
irony.</p>

<p>Then he wrote a masterly little note, perfect in its correctness, and
yet instinct with the power and knowledge of a commander who had a
mind of his own. He wrote as follows, and told me to hand the message
to the returning despatch-rider:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"Ref. your B.M. 85 dated 25th Sept., I regret that I shall not
be able to move one section per battery into action to-night.</p>

<p>"I was late in returning from my reconnaissance owing to delay
in fixing position for my Brigade Headquarters; did not get the
order until eight o'clock, and by that time batteries had
started moving ammunition up to the positions. All available
guides had gone up with the ammunition waggons.</p>

<p>"My batteries will be prepared to fire a barrage by dawn on 27th
Sept.</p>

<p>"In confirmation of my telephone conversation with B.M. to-day
positions selected are as follows:&mdash;"</p></div>

<p>The message closed with the map co-ordinates of the positions chosen
for our four batteries, and with a request for the map location of the
Divisional Artillery Headquarters, to which the note was sent.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>Next day, the 26th, was a day of busy preparation. We learned that,
for the first time, we should be in active co-operation with an
American Division. The infantry of the British Division we were
working under had been told off to protect the left flank of the
American Division. The object of the attack was the capture of the
last dominating strong-posts that guarded a section of the Hindenburg
Line, immediately north of the section for which our own Divisional
infantry had battled since Sept. 19. The enemy was to be surprised.
Our guns, when placed in position, had to remain silent until they
began the barrage on the 27th. That morning, therefore, topographical
experts busied themselves ascertaining exact map locations of the
batteries' positions so as to ensure accurate shooting by the map. The
point was emphasised by the colonel, who wrote to all batteries:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"Battery Commanders are reminded that as barrages on morning of
27th will be fired without previous registration of guns.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">The line laid out must not be entirely dependent on compass
bearing.</span> Check it by measuring angles to points which can
be identified on the map. All calculations to be made by two
officers working separately, who will then check each other.</p>

<p>"Every precaution must be taken not to attract the attention of
the enemy to batteries moving forward into action. Nothing to be
taken up in daylight, except in the event of <i>very</i> bad
visibility."</p></div>

<p>The colonel rode over to see the C.R.A. of the Division to whom our
Brigade had been loaned. After lunch he held a battery commanders'
conference in his tent, and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>explained the morrow's barrage scheme.
"Ernest," the dog, spent a delighted frolicsome hour chasing a Rugby
football that some Australians near our waggon lines brought out for
practice. Hubbard went on to the new positions to lay out his
telephone lines. I occupied myself completing returns for the staff
captain.</p>

<p>By five o'clock I had joined the colonel and Hubbard at the new
positions. Our only possible mess was a roofless gun-pit not far from
a road. The colonel and Hubbard were covering it with scrap-heap
sheets of rusty iron, and a tarpaulin that was not sufficiently
expansive. Further down the road was a dug-out into which two could
squeeze. The colonel said Hubbard and I had better occupy it. He
preferred to sleep in the gun-pit, and already had gathered up a few
armfuls of grasses and heather to lie upon. Manning and the cook had
discovered a hole of their own, and the two clerks and the orderlies
had cramped themselves into a tiny bivouac.</p>

<p>The final fastening-down of the gun-pit roof was enlivened by heavy
enemy shelling of a battery four hundred yards north-east of us.
Several splinters whistled past, and one flying piece of iron, four
inches long and an inch wide, missed my head by about a foot and
buried itself in the earthen floor of the mess. "That's the narrowest
escape you've had for some time," smiled the colonel.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later the brigade clerk brought me the evening's batch of
Divisional messages and routine orders. This was the first one I
glanced at:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"Wire by return name of war-tired captain or subaltern, if any,

<h3>XVII. WITH THE AMERICANS<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />


<p>Sept. 27: Our meetings with the Americans had so far been pretty
casual. We had seen parties of them in June and July, training in the
Contay area, north of the Albert-Amiens road; and one day during that
period I accompanied our colonel and the colonel of our companion
brigade on a motor trip to the coast, and we passed some thousands of
them hard at work getting fit, and training with almost fervid
enthusiasm. It used to be a joke of mine that on one occasion my horse
shied because an Australian private saluted me. No one could make a
friendly jest of like kind against the American soldiers. When first
they arrived in France no troops were more punctilious in practising
the outward and visible evidences of discipline. Fit, with the perfect
fitness of the man from 23 to 28, not a weed amongst them,
intelligent-looking, splendidly eager to learn, they were much akin in
physique and general qualities to our own immortal "First Hundred
Thousand." I came across colonels and majors of the New York and
Illinois Divisions getting experience in the line with our brigadiers
and colonels. I have seen U.S. Army N.C.O.'s out in the field
receiving instruction from picked N.C.O.'s of our army in the art of
shouting orders. Their officers and men undertook this training with a
certain shy solemnity that I myself thought very attractive. I am
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>doing no lip-service to a "wish is father to the thought" sentiment
when I say that a manly modesty in respect to military achievements
characterised all the fighting American soldiers that I met.</p>

<p>They were not long in tumbling into the humours of life at the front.
I remember an episode told with much enjoyment by a major of the
regular U.S. Army, who spent a liaison fortnight with our Division.</p>

<p>There is a word that appears at least once a day on orders sent out
from the "Q" or administrative branch of the British Army. It is the
word "Return": "Return of Personnel," "Casualty Returns," "Ammunition
Returns," &amp;c., all to do with the compilation of reports. The American
Division to which the major belonged had been included among the units
of a British Corps. When, in course of time, the Division was
transferred elsewhere Corps Q branch wired, "Return wanted of all
tents and trench shelters in your possession." Next day the American
Division received a second message: "Re my 0546/8023, hasten return of
tents and trench shelters."</p>

<p>The day following the Corps people were startled by the steady arrival
of scores of tents and trench shelters. The wires hummed furiously,
and the Corps staff captain shouted his hardest, explaining over a
long-distance telephone that "Hasten return" did not mean "Send back
as quickly as possible."</p>

<p>"And we thought we had got a proper move on sending back those tents,"
concluded the American major who told me the story.</p>

<p>And now we were in action with these virile ardent fellows. Two of
their Divisions took part in the great battle which at 5.30
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> opened on a 35-mile front&mdash;ten days of bloody victorious
fighting, by which three armies shattered the last and strongest of
the enemy's <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>fully-prepared positions, and struck a vital blow at his
main communications.</p>

<p>The first news on Sept. 27th was of the best. On our part of the front
the Americans had swept forward, seized the two ruined farms that were
their earliest objectives, and surged to the top of a knoll that had
formed a superb point of vantage for the Boche observers. By 7.30
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> the Brigade was told to warn F.O.O.'s that our bombers
would throw red flares outside the trenches along which they were
advancing to indicate their position.</p>

<p>But again there was to be no walk-over. The Boche counter-attack was
delivered on the Americans' left flank. We were ordered to fire a
two-hours' bombardment upon certain points towards which the enemy was
pouring his troops; and the colonel told me to instruct our two
F.O.O.'s to keep a particular look-out for hostile movement.</p>

<p>By 11 <span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> Division issued instructions for all gun dumps to
be made up that night to 500 rounds per gun. "Stiff fighting ahead,"
commented the colonel.</p>

<p>At three o'clock Dumble, who was commanding A Battery, Major Bullivant
having gone on leave, reported that the Americans were withdrawing
from the knoll to trenches four hundred yards in rear, where they were
reorganising their position.</p>

<p>That settled the fighting for the day, although there was speedy
indication of the Boche's continued liveliness: a plane came over, and
by a daring man&oelig;uvre set fire to three of our "sausage" balloons,
the observers having to tumble out with their parachutes. All this
time I had remained glued to the telephone for the receipt of news and
the passing of orders. There was opportunity now to give thought to
the fortifying of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>our headquarters. Hubbard, who prided himself on
his biceps, had engaged in a brisk discussion with the officers of a
near-by Artillery brigade headquarters regarding the dug-out that he
and myself and "Ernest" had occupied the night before. Originally it
had been arranged that we should share quarters with them, dug-outs in
a neighbouring bank having been allotted for their overflow of
signallers. But at the last moment an Infantry brigade headquarters
had "commandeered" part of their accommodation, and they gave up the
dug-out that Hubbard and I had slept in, with the intimation that they
would want it on the morrow. As Hubbard had discovered that they were
in possession of four good dug-outs on the opposite side of the road,
he said we ought to be allowed to retain our solitary one. But no!
they stuck to their rights, and during the morning's battle a stream
of protesting officers came to interview Hubbard. Their orderly
officer was suave but anxious; their signalling officer admitted the
previous arrangement to share quarters; Hubbard remained firm, and
said that if the Infantry brigade had upset their arrangements, they
themselves had upset ours. I was too busy to enter at length into the
argument, but I agreed to send a waggon and horses to fetch material
if they chose to build a new place. When their adjutant came over and
began to use sarcasm, I referred the matter to our colonel, who
decided, "Their Division has sent us here. The dug-out is in our area.
There is no other accommodation. We shall keep it."</p>

<p>"Will you come over and see our colonel, sir?" asked the adjutant
persuasively.</p>

<p>"Certainly not," replied the colonel with some asperity.</p>

<p>The next arrivals were a gas officer and a tall <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>ebullient Irish
doctor, who said that the dug-out had been prepared for them. Hubbard
conveyed our colonel's decision, and ten minutes later his servant
brought news that the doctor's servant had been into the dug-out and
replaced our kit by the doctor's.</p>

<p>Hubbard, smiling happily, slipped out of our gun-pit mess, and the
next item of news from this bit of front informed me that our valises
had been replaced and the doctor's kit put outside. Hubbard told me he
had informed the doctor and the gas officer that, our colonel having
made his decision, he was prepared to repeat the performance every
time they invaded the dug-out. "And I was ready to throw them after
their kit if necessary," he added, expanding his chest.</p>

<p>The upshot of it all was that our horses fetched fresh material, and
we helped to find the doctor and the gas officer a home.</p>

<p>The battle continued next day, our infantry nibbling their way into
the Boche defences and allowing him no rest. The artillery work was
not so strenuous as on the previous day, and Hubbard and I decided to
dig a dug-out for the colonel. It was bonny exercise for me. "I think
every adjutant ought to have a pit to dig in&mdash;adjutants get too little
exercise," I told the colonel. After which Hubbard, crouching with his
pick, offered practical tuition in the science of underpinning. We
sweated hard and enjoyed our lunch. Judd and young Beale reported back
from leave, and Beale caused a sensation by confessing that he had got
married. A Corps wire informed every unit that Lance-Corporal
Kleinberg-Hermann, "5 ft. 8, fair hair, eyes blue, scar above nose,
one false tooth in front, dressed German uniform," and Meyer Hans, "6
ft., fair hair, brown eyes, thin face, wears glasses, speaks English
and French <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>fluently, dressed German uniform," had escaped from a
prisoners of war camp. The mail brought a letter from which the
colonel learnt that a long-time friend, a lieut.-colonel in the
Garrison Artillery, had been killed. He had lunched with us one day in
June, a bright-eyed, grizzled veteran, with a whimsical humour. India
had made him look older than his years. "They found his body in No
Man's Land," said the colonel softly. "They couldn't get to it for two
days."</p>

<p>At half-past nine that night we learned that our own Divisional
infantry were coming up in front of us again. There was to be another
big attack, to complete the work begun by the Americans, and at zero
hour we should pass under the command of our Divisional artillery. At
four in the morning the telephone near my pillow woke me up, and Major
Bartlett reported that the Boche had started a barrage. "I don't think
he suspects anything," said the major. "It's only ordinary
counter-preparation." In any case it didn't affect our attack, which
started with splendid zest. The Boche plunked a few gas shells near
us; but by 9.15 the brigade-major told me that the Americans and our
own infantry had advanced a thousand yards and were on their first
objective. "I smell victory to-day," said the colonel, looking at his
map. By half-past ten Major Bartlett's battery had moved forward two
thousand yards, and the major had joined a battalion commander so as
to keep pace with the onward rush of the infantry.</p>

<p>Good news tumbled in. At 10.50 the intelligence officer of our
companion Artillery brigade rang up to tell me that their liaison
officer had seen our troops entering the southern end of a well-known
village that lay along the canal.</p>

<p>"Ring up A and B at once," interjected the colonel, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>"and tell them to
stop their bursts of fire, otherwise they will be firing on our own
people. Tell our liaison officer with the &nbsp;&mdash;th Infantry Brigade that
we are no longer firing on the village.... And increase the how.
battery's range by 1000 yards."</p>

<p>Five minutes later the brigade-major let us know that the Corps on our
left had cleared a vastly important ridge, but their most northerly
Division was held up by machine-gun fire. When the situation was eased
they would advance upon the canal. Our D Battery was now firing at
maximum range, and at 11.20 the colonel ordered them to move up
alongside C.</p>

<p>The exhilarating swiftness of the success infected every one. Drysdale
rang up to know whether we hadn't any fresh targets for D Battery.
"I'm sure we've cleared out every Boche in the quarry you gave us," he
said. The staff captain told us he was bringing forward his ammunition
dumps. The old wheeler was observed to smile. Even the telephone
seemed to be working better than for months past. In restraint of
over-eagerness, complaints of short shooting filtered in from the
infantry, but I established the fact that our batteries were not the
sinners.</p>

<p>By tea-time all the batteries had advanced, and the colonel, "Ernest,"
and myself were walking at the head of the headquarters waggon and
mess carts through a village that a fortnight before had been a hotbed
of Germany's hardest fighting infantry.</p>

<p>The longer the time spent in the fighting area, the stronger that
secret spasm of apprehension when a shift forward to new positions had
to be made. The ordinary honest-souled member of His Majesty's forces
will admit that to be a true saying. The average healthy-minded
recruit coming to the Western Front since July 1916 <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>marvelled for his
first six months on the thousands of hostile shells that he saw
hitting nothing in particular, and maiming and killing nobody. If he
survived a couple of years he lost all curiosity about shells that did
no harm; he had learned that in the forward areas there was never real
safety, the fatal shell might come at the most unexpected moment, in
the most unlooked-for spot: it might be one solitary missile of death,
it might accompany a hideous drove that beat down the earth all
around, and drenched a whole area with sickening scorching fumes; he
might not show it, but he had learned to fear.</p>

<p>But on this move-up we were agog with the day's fine news. We were in
the mood to calculate on the extent of the enemy's retirement: for the
moment his long-range guns had ceased to fire. We talked seriously of
the war ending by Christmas. We laughed when I opened the first
Divisional message delivered at our new Headquarters: "Divisional
Cinema will open at Lieramont to-morrow. Performances twice daily, 3
<span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> and 6 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>" "That looks as if our infantry are
moving out," I said.</p>

<p>We had taken over a bank and some shallow, aged dug-outs, occupied the
night before by our C Battery; and as there was a chill in the air
that foretold rain, and banks of sombre clouds were lining up in the
western sky, we unloaded our carts and set to work getting our
belongings under cover while it was still light. "There's no pit for
you to dig in," the colonel told me quizzingly, "but you can occupy
yourself filling these ammunition boxes with earth; they'll make walls
for the mess." Hubbard had been looking for something heavy to carry;
he brought an enormous beam from the broad-gauge railway that lay a
hundred yards west <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>of us. The colonel immediately claimed it for the
mess roof. "We'll fix it centre-wise on the ammunition boxes to
support the tarpaulin," he decided. "Old Fritz has done his dirtiest
along the railway," said Hubbard cheerfully. "He's taken a bit out of
every rail; and he's blown a mine a quarter of a mile down there
that's giving the sappers something to think about. They told me they
want to have trains running in two days."</p>

<p>Meanwhile the signallers had been cleaning out the deep shaft they
were to work in; the cooks and the clerks had selected their own
rabbit-hutches; and I had picked a semi-detached dug-out in which were
wire beds for the colonel, Hubbard, and myself. True, a shell had made
a hole in one corner of the iron roof, and the place was of such
antiquity that rats could be heard squeaking in the vicinity of my
bed-head, but I hoped that a map-board fixed behind my pillow would
protect me from unpleasantness.</p>

<p>The colonel was suspicious of the S.O.S. line issued to us by Division
that night. The ordinary rules of gunnery provide that the angle of
sight to be put on the guns can be calculated from the difference
between the height of the ground on which the battery stands and the
height at the target. More often than not ridges intervene between the
gun and the target, and the height and position of these ridges
sometimes cause complications in the reckoning of the angle of sight,
particularly if a high ridge is situated close to the object to be
shot at. Without going into full explanation, I hope I may be
understood when I say that the correct angle of sight, calculated from
the map difference in height between battery and target, occasionally
fails to ensure that the curve described by the shell in its flight
will finish sufficiently high <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>in the air for the shell to clear the
final crest. When that happens shells fall on the wrong side of the
ridge, and our own infantry are endangered. It is a point to which
brigade-majors and brigade commanders naturally give close attention.</p>

<p>The colonel looked at his map, shook his head, said, "I don't like
that ridge," and got out his ruler and made calculations. Then he
talked over the telephone to the brigade-major. "Yes, I know that
theoretically, by every ordinary test, we should be safe in shooting
there, and I know what you want to shoot at.... But there's a risk,
and I should prefer to be on the safe side.... Will you speak to the
General about it?"</p>

<p>The colonel gained his point, and at 10.20 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span> issued a
further order to the batteries:&mdash;</p>

<div class="block"><p>"Previous S.O.S. line is cancelled, as it is found that the
hillside is so steep that our troops in Tino Support Trench may
be hit.</p>

<p>"Complaints of short shooting have been frequent all day.
Henceforth S.O.S. will be as follows...."</p></div>

<p>"I'll write out those recommendations for honours and awards before
turning in," he said, a quarter of an hour later, searching through
the box in which confidential papers were kept. "Now, what was it I
wanted to know?&mdash;oh, I remember. Ring up Drysdale, and ask him whether
the corporal he put in is named Marchman or Marshman. His writing is
not very clear.... If he's gone to bed, say I'm sorry to disturb him,
but these things want to be got in as soon as possible."</p>

<p>It was a quiet night as far as shell-fire was concerned, but a furious
rain-storm permitted us very little sleep, and played havoc with the
mess. Our documents remained safe, though most of them were saturated
with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>water. In the morning it was cold enough to make one rub one's
hands and stamp the feet. There was plenty of exercise awaiting us in
the enlarging and rebuilding of the mess. We made it a very secure
affair this time. "What about a fire, sir?" inquired Hubbard.</p>

<p>"Good idea," said the colonel. He and Hubbard used pick and shovel to
fashion a vertical, triangular niche in the side of the bank. The
staff-sergeant fitter returned with a ten-foot stove-pipe that he had
found in the neighbouring village; and before ten o'clock our first
mess fire since the end of April was crackling merrily and burning up
spare ammunition boxes.</p>

<p>The colonel went off to tour the batteries, saying, "I'll leave you to
fight the battle." The brigade-major's first telephone talk at 10.35
<span class="fakesc">A.M.</span> left no doubt that we were pushing home all the
advantages gained the day before. "I want one good burst on &nbsp;&mdash;&mdash;&nbsp;
Trench," he said. "After that cease firing this side of the canal
until I tell you to go on." The news an hour later was that our
Divisional Infantry patrols were working methodically through
Vendhuile, the village on the canal bank, which the Americans had
entered the day before. Next "Buller," who was with the Infantry
brigade, called up, and said that the mopping-up in the village had
been most successful: our fellows were thrusting for the canal bridge,
and had yet to encounter any large enemy forces. At twenty to one the
brigade-major told me that our people were moving steadily to the
other side of the canal. "We're properly over the Hindenburg Line this
time," he wound up.</p>

<p>The Brigadier-General C.R.A. came to see us during the afternoon, and
we learned for the first time that on the previous day the Americans
had fought their way right through Vendhuile, but, on account of
their <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>impetuosity, had lost touch with their supports. "They fought
magnificently, but didn't mop-up as they went along," explained the
General. "The Boche tried the trick he used to play on us. He hid
until the first wave had gone by, and then came up with his
machine-guns and fired into their backs.... It's a great pity.... I'm
afraid that six hundred of them who crossed the canal have been wiped
out."</p>

<p>"I hear that our infantry go out for a proper rest as soon as this is
over," he added. "They brought them up again to complete the smashing
of the Hindenburg Line, because they didn't want to draw upon the
three absolutely fresh Divisions they were keeping to chase the Hun
immediately he yielded the Hindenburg Line. Our infantry must have
fought themselves to a standstill these last three weeks."</p>

<p>"Any news about us?" inquired the colonel.</p>

<p>"No; I'm afraid the gunners will have to carry on as usual.... The
horses seem to be surviving the ordeal very well...."</p>

<p>At 4.25 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>&mdash;I particularly remember noting the time&mdash;we
were told by Division that Bulgaria's surrender was unconditional.
"That will be cheering news for the batteries," observed the colonel.
"I'd send that out." The brigade-major also informed us that British
cavalry were reported to be at Roulers, north-east of Ypres&mdash;but that
wasn't official. "Anyhow," said the colonel, his face glowing, "it
shows the right spirit. Yes, I think the war will be over by Christmas
after all."</p>

<p>"It would be great to be home by Christmas, sir," put in Hubbard.</p>

<p>"Yes," responded the colonel in the same vein, "but it wouldn't be so
bad even out here.... I don't think <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>any of us would really mind
staying another six months if we had no 5&middot;9's to worry us." And he
settled down to writing his daily letter home.</p>

<p>October came in with every one joyously expectant. The enemy still
struggled to hold the most valuable high ground on the far side of the
canal, but there was little doubt that he purposed a monster
withdrawal&mdash;and our batteries did their best to quicken his decision.
The brigade-major departed for a Senior Staff Course in England, and
Major "Pat" of our sister brigade, a highly efficient and extremely
popular officer, who, with no previous knowledge of soldiering, had
won deserved distinction, filled his place. Major "Pat" was a disciple
of cheering news for the batteries. "This has just come in by the
wireless," he telephoned to me on October 2nd. "Turkey
surrendered&mdash;British ships sailing through the Dardanelles&mdash;Lille
being evacuated&mdash;British bluejackets landed at Ostend."</p>

<p>"Is that official?" I asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>He laughed. "No, I didn't say that.... It's a wireless report."</p>

<p>"Not waggon line?" I went on.</p>

<p>He laughed again. "No, I'll let you know when it becomes official."</p>

<p>Formal intimation was to hand that Dumble, Judd, Bob Pottinger, young
Beale, Stenson, and Tincler had been awarded the Military Cross, and
Major Veasey the D.S.O. Drysdale was happy because, after many times
of asking, he had got back from headquarters, Patrick, the black
charger that he had ridden early in 1916.</p>

<p>The tide of success rolled on. A swift little attack on the morning of
October 3rd took the infantry we were supporting, now that our own
battalions had withdrawn for a fortnight's rest, on to valuable high
ground <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>east of the canal. "They met with such little opposition that
our barrage became merely an escort," was the way in which Beadle, who
was doing F.O.O., described the advance. Surrendering Germans poured
back in such numbers that dozens of them walked unattended to the
prisoners of war cages. "I saw one lot come down," a D.A.C. officer
told me. "All that the sentry had to do was to point to the cage with
a 'This-way-in' gesture, and in they marched."</p>

<p>One wee cloud blurred the high-spirited light-heartedness of those
days. We lost "Ernest," who had marched forward with us and been our
pet since Sept. 6th. The colonel and Hubbard took him up the line; the
little fellow didn't seem anxious to leave me that morning, but I
thought that a run would do him good, and he had followed the colonel
a couple of days before. "I'm sorry, but we've lost 'Ernest,'" was the
colonel's bluntly told news when he returned. "He disappeared when I
was calling on B Battery.... They said he went over the hill with an
infantry officer, who had made much of him.... It's curious, because
he stuck to us when I went to see the infantry at Brigade
Headquarters, although every one in their very long dug-out fussed
over him."</p>

<p>There was poor chance of the dog finding his way back to us in that
country of many tracks, amid the coming to and fro of thousands of all
kinds of troops. We never saw or heard of him again. The loss of him
dispirited all of us a bit; and I suppose I felt it more than most: he
had been a splendid little companion for nearly a month.</p>

<p>The adjutant and Wilde returned from leave on Oct. 3rd, full of the
bright times to be spent in London. "People in England think the war's
all over. They <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>don't realise that pursuing the Boche means fighting
him as well," burst forth the adjutant. "By Gad," he went on, "we had
a narrow escape the day we went on leave. I never saw anything like it
in my life. You remember the factory at Moislains, near the place
where we were out for three or four days at the beginning of last
month. Well, Wilde and I caught a leave bus that went that way on the
road to Amiens. The bus had to pull up about five hundred yards short
of the factory, because there was a lot of infantry in front of us....
And just at that moment a Boche mine blew up.... Made an awful
mess.... About eleven men killed.... We had taken the place three
weeks before, and the mine had remained undiscovered all that time....
We must all of us have passed over that spot many times. You remember
they made a Red Cross Station of the factory.... A most extraordinary
thing!"</p>

<p>The Boche fire had died away almost entirely; it was manifest that the
Brigade would have to move forward. I could go on leave now that the
adjutant was back&mdash;Beadle and myself were the only two officers in the
Brigade who had gone through the March retreat and not yet been on
leave to England; but I was keen on another trip forward with the
colonel, and on the morning of the 4th Wilde and I joined him on a
prospecting ride, looking for new positions for the batteries.</p>

<p>It was a journey that quickened all one's powers of observation. We
went forward a full five miles, over yellow churned wastes that four
days before had been crowded battlefields; past shell-pocked stretches
that had been made so by our own guns. At first we trotted along a
straight road that a short time before had been seamed with Boche
trenches and barbed wire. The colonel's mare was fresh and ready to
shy at heaps of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>stones and puddles. "She's got plenty of spirit
still," said the colonel, "but she's not the mare she was before the
hit in the neck at Commenchon. However, I know her limitations, and
she's all right providing I spare her going uphill."</p>

<p>Just outside the half-mile long village of Ronssoy he pointed to a
clump of broken bricks and shattered beams. "That's the farm that D
Battery insisted was Gillemont Farm, when we were at Cliffe Post on
September 19," he explained. "The day I was with him at the 'O.P.,'
Wood couldn't understand why he was unable to see his shells fall. He
telephoned to the battery to check the range they were firing at, and
then decided that the map was wrong. When I told him to examine his
map more closely he spotted the 140 contour between this place and
Gillemont Farm. It made Gillemont Farm invisible from the 'O.P.' Of
course Gillemont Farm is 2000 yards beyond this place."</p>

<p>We reached a battered cross-roads 1200 yards due south of Duncan Post,
that cockpit of the bitter hand-to-hand fighting of Sept. 19th and
20th. A couple of captured Boche 4&middot;2's&mdash;the dreaded high-velocity
gun&mdash;stood tucked behind a low grassless bank, their curved, muddy,
camouflaged shields blending with the brown desolation of the
landscape. Two American soldiers saluted the colonel gravely&mdash;lean,
tanned, straight-eyed young fellows. For the first time I noticed that
the Americans were wearing puttees like our men, instead of the canvas
gaiters which they sported when first in France. Their tin hats and
box-respirators have always been the same make as ours.</p>

<p>The colonel stopped to look at his map. "We'll turn north-east here
and cross the canal at Bony," he said. We rode round newly-dug
shell-slits, and through gaps <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>in the tangled, rusted barbed wire; at
one spot we passed eighteen American dead, laid out in two neat rows,
ready for removal to the cemetery that the U.S. Army had established
in the neighbourhood; we went within twenty yards of a disabled tank
that a land mine had rendered <i>hors de combat</i>; we came across another
tank lumbered half-way across a road. "Tanks always seem to take it
into their heads to collapse on a main road and interrupt traffic,"
muttered the colonel sardonically.</p>

<p>There were twelve hundred yards of a straight sunken road for us to
ride through before we reached Bony. That road was a veritable gallery
of German dead. They lay in twos and threes, in queer horrible
postures, along its whole unkempt length, some of them with blackened
decomposed faces and hands, most of them newly killed, for this was a
road that connected the outer defences of the Hindenburg Line with the
network of wire and trenches that formed the Hindenburg Line itself.
"Best sight I've seen since the war," said Wilde with satisfaction.
And if the colonel and myself made no remark we showed no
disagreement. Pity for dead Boche finds no place in the average
decent-minded man's composition. Half a dozen of our armoured cars,
wheels off, half-burned, or their steering apparatus smashed, lay on
the entrenched and wired outskirts of Bony, part of the Hindenburg
Line proper. In the village itself we found Red Cross cars filling up
with wounded; Boche prisoners were being used as stretcher-bearers;
groups of waiting infantry stood in the main street; runners flitted
to and fro.</p>

<p>"We'll leave our horses here," said the colonel; and the grooms guided
them to the shelter of a high solid wall. The colonel, Wilde, and I
ascended the main street, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>making eastward. A couple of 5&middot;9's dropped
close to the northern edge of the village as we came out of it. We met
a party of prisoners headed by two officers&mdash;one short, fat, nervous,
dark, bespectacled; the other bearded, lanky, nonchalant, and of good
carriage. He carried a gold-nobbed Malacca cane. Neither officer
looked at us as we passed. The tall one reminded me of an officer
among the first party of Boche prisoners I saw in France in August
1916. His arrogant, disdainful air had roused in me a gust of anger
that made me glad I was in the war.</p>

<p>We went through a garden transformed into a dust-bin, and dipped down
a hummocky slope that rose again to a chalky ridge. Shells were
screaming overhead in quick succession now, and we walked fast, making
for a white boulder that looked as if it would offer shielded
observation and protection. We found ourselves near the top of one of
the giant air-shafts that connected with the canal tunnel. Tufts of
smoke spouted up at regular intervals on the steep slope behind the
village below us. "We're in time to see a barrage," remarked the
colonel, pulling out his binoculars. "Our people are trying to secure
the heights. I didn't know that Gouy was quite clear of Boche. There
was fighting there yesterday."</p>

<p>"There are some Boche in a trench near that farm on the left," he
added a minute later, after sweeping the hills opposite with his
glasses. "Can you see them?"</p>

<p>I made out what did appear to be three grey tin-helmeted figures, but
I could see nothing of our infantry. The shelling went on, but time
pressed, and the colonel, packing up his glasses, led us eastwards
again, down to a light-railway junction, and through a quaint little
ravine lined with willow-trees. Many German dead lay here. One young
soldier, who had died with his head thrown <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>back resting against a
green bank, his blue eyes open to the sky, wore a strangely perfect
expression of peace and rest. Up another ascending sunken road. The
Boche guns seemed to have switched, and half a dozen shells skimmed
the top of the road, causing us to wait. We looked again at the fight
being waged on the slopes behind the village. Our barrage had lifted,
but we saw no sign of advancing infantry.</p>

<p>The colonel turned to me suddenly and said, "I'm going to select
positions about a thousand yards south of where we are at this
moment&mdash;along the valley. Wilde will come with me. You go back and
pick up the horses, and meet us at Quennemont Farm. I expect we shall
be there almost as soon as you."</p>

<p>I followed the direct road to return to Bony. A few shells dropped on
either side of the road, which was obviously a hunting-ground for the
Boche gunners. At least a dozen British dead lay at intervals huddled
against the sides of the road. One of them looked to be an artillery
officer, judged by his field-boots and spurs. But the top part of him
was covered by a rain-proof coat, and I saw no cap.</p>

<p>Quennemont Farm was a farm only in name. There was no wall more than
three feet high left standing; the whole place was shapeless, stark,
blasted into nothingness. In the very centre of the mournful chaos lay
three disembowelled horses and an overturned Boche ammunition waggon.
The shells were still on the shelves. They were Yellow Cross, the
deadliest of the Boche mustard-gas shell.</p>

<p>I went on leave next morning, and got a motor-car lift from Peronne as
far as Amiens. Before reaching Villers-Bretonneux, of glorious,
fearful memories, we passed through Warfusee-Abancourt, a shell of its
former <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>self, a brick heap, a monument of devastation. An aged man and
a slim white-faced girl were standing by the farm cart that had
brought them there, the first civilians I had seen since August. The
place was deserted save for them. In sad bereavement they looked at
the cruel desolation around them.</p>

<p>"My God," said my companion, interpreting my inmost thought, "what a
home-coming!"</p>

<h3>XVIII. A LAST DAY AT THE O.P.<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>When, on October 21, I returned to France, the war had made a very big
stride towards its end. Cambrai had been regained, and Le Cateau&mdash;"Lee
Katoo," the men insisted on calling it&mdash;taken. Ostend was ours, Lille
was ours; over Palestine we had cast our mantle. Our own Division,
still hard at it, had gone forward twenty-four miles during my
fortnight's leave in England. Stories of their doings trickled towards
me when I broke the journey at Amiens on my way back to the lines. I
met an Infantry captain bound for England.</p>

<p>"It's been all open fighting this last fortnight&mdash;cavalry, and forced
marches, and all that&mdash;and I don't want to hear any more talk of the
new Armies not being able to carry out a war of movement," he said
chirpily. "The men have been magnificent. The old Boche is done now;
but we're making no mistakes&mdash;we're after him all the while.</p>

<p>"Dam funny, you know, some of the things that are happening up there.
The Boche has left a lot of coal dumps behind, and every one's after
it. There's a 2000-ton pile at Le Cateau, and it was disappearing so
rapidly that they put a guard on it. I was walking with my colonel the
other day, and we came across an Australian shovelling coal from this
dump into a G.S. waggon. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>A sentry, with fixed bayonet, was marching
up an' down.</p>

<p>"The colonel stopped when we came to the sentry, and asked him what he
was supposed to be doing.</p>

<p>"'Guarding the coal dump, sir.'</p>

<p>"'But what is this Australian doing? Has he any authority to draw
coal? Did he show you a chit?'</p>

<p>"'No, sir,' replied the sentry. 'I thought, as he had a Government
waggon, it would be all right.'</p>

<p>"'Upon my Sam!' said the colonel, astonished. Then he tackled the
Australian.</p>

<p>"'What authority have you for taking away this coal?' he asked.</p>

<p>"The Australian stood up and said, 'I don't want any authority&mdash;I
bally well fought for it,' and went on with his shovelling.</p>

<p>"Frankly, the colonel didn't know what to say; but he has a sense of
humour. 'Extraordinary fellows!' he said to me as we walked off.</p>

<p>"Then we came across an American who was 'scrounging' or something in
an empty house. He jumped to attention when he saw the colonel, and
saluted very smartly. But what do you think? He saluted with a bowler
hat on,&mdash;found it in the house, I expect.... I tell you, it was an
eye-opening day for the colonel."</p>

<p>I lorry-hopped to the village that I had been told was Divisional
Headquarters; but they had moved the day before, seven miles farther
forward. There were nearly 200 civilians here. I saw a few faded,
ancient men in worn corduroys and blue-peaked caps; a bent old crone,
in a blue apron, hobbled with a water-bucket past a corner shop&mdash;a
grocer's&mdash;shuttered, sluttish from want of paint; three tiny children,
standing in doorways, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>wore a strangely old expression. There was a
pathetically furtive air about all these people. For four years they
had been under the Boche. Of actual, death-bringing, frightening war
they had seen not more than five days. The battle had swept over and
beyond them, carrying with it the feared and hated German, and the
main fighting force of the pursuing British as well. But it was too
soon yet for them to forget, or to throw off a sort of lurking dread
that even now the Boche might return.</p>

<p>I got a lift in another lorry along a road crumbling under the unusual
amount of traffic that weighed upon it. Our advance had been so swift
that the war scars on the countryside had not entirely blighted its
normal characteristics. Here were shell-holes, but no long succession
of abandoned gun-positions, few horse-tracks, fewer trenches, and no
barbed wire. The villages we went through had escaped obliterating
shell fire. I learned that our attacks had been planned thus-wise.
Near a bleak cross-roads I saw Collinge of B Battery, and got off the
lorry to talk to him.</p>

<p>"Brigade Headquarters are at Bousies, about six miles from here," he
said. "I'm going that way. The batteries are all in Bousies."</p>

<p>"What sort of a time have you had?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Oh, most exciting! Shan't forget the day we crossed the Le Cateau
river. We were the advance Brigade. The Engineers were supposed to put
bridges across for us; the material came up all right, but the
pioneers who were to do the work missed the way. The sapper officer
who had brought the material wanted to wait till the proper people
arrived, but the Boche was shelling and machine-gunning like mad, and
the colonel said that bridge-building must be got on with at once.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>The colonel was great that day. Old Johns of D Battery kept buzzing
along with suggestions, but the colonel put his foot down, and said,
'It's the sapper officer's work; let him do it.' And the bridges were
really well put up. All the guns got across safely, although C Battery
had a team knocked out."</p>

<p>I walked by Collinge's side through a village of sloping roofs,
single-storied red-brick houses, and mud-clogged streets. It was the
village which our two brigades of artillery occupied when the
Armistice was signed, where the King came to see us, and M. le Maire,
in his excitement, gave His Majesty that typically French, shall I
say? clasp of intimacy and brotherliness, a left-handed handshake.</p>

<p>"Curious thing happened on that rise," remarked Collinge when we were
in open country again. "The colonel and the adjutant were with an
infantry General and his Staff officers, reconnoitring. The General
had a little bitch something like a whippet. She downed a hare, and
though it brought them into view of the Boche, the General, the
colonel, and the others chased after them like mad. I believe the
colonel won the race&mdash;but the adjutant will tell you all about it."</p>

<p>Away on the left a lone tree acted as a landmark for a sunken road.
"Brigade tried to make a headquarters there," went on Collinge, "but a
signaller got knocked out, and the Boche began using the tree as a
datum point; so the colonel ordered a shift." Twenty rough wooden
crosses rose mournful and remote in a wide, moist mangel-field. "The
cavalry got it badly there," said Collinge. "A 4&middot;2 gun turned on them
from close range, and did frightful execution." We were near to a
cross-road, marked balefully by a two-storied house, cut in half so
that the interior was opened to view like a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>doll's house, and by
other shell-mauled buildings. "The batteries came into action under
that bank," he continued, pointing his cane towards a valley riddled
with shell-holes. "That's where Dumble did so well. Came along with
the cavalry an hour and a half before any Horse Artillery battery, and
brought his guns up in line, like F.A.T.... See that cemetery on the
top of the hill?... the Boche made it in August 1914; lot of the old
Army buried there, and it's been jolly well looked after. The colonel
walked round and looked at every grave one day; he said he'd never
seen a better cared-for cemetery.... We had an 'O.P.' there for the
Richemont River fight. The Boche shelled it like blazes some days....
And we saw great sights up that <i>pav&eacute;</i> road there, over the dip. They
held a big conference there; all sorts of Generals turned up.... Staff
cars that looked like offices, with the maps and operation orders
pinned up inside; and when our battery went by, the road was so packed
with traffic that infantry were marching along in fours on either side
of the road."</p>

<p>We reached the outskirts of Le Cateau, descending a steep <i>pav&eacute;</i> road.
"They shelled this place like stink yesterday," Collinge told me.
"Headquarters were in one of those little houses on the left for one
night, and their waggon line is there now, so you'll be able to get a
horse.... I heard that Major Bartlett had both his chargers killed
yesterday when C Battery came through.... Isn't that one of them, that
black horse lying under the trees?"</p>

<p>I looked and saw many horses lying dead on both sides of the road, and
thought little of it. That was war. Then all my senses were strung up
to attention: a small bay horse lay stretched out on the pathway, his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>head near the kerb. There was a shapeliness of the legs and a fineness
of the mud-checkered coat that seemed familiar. I stepped over to
look. Yes, it was my own horse "Tommy," that old Castle, our
ex-adjutant, had given me&mdash;old Castle's "handy little horse." A gaping
hole in the head told all that needed to be told. I found "Swiffy" and
the doctor in the workman's cottage that had become Brigade
waggon-line headquarters. Yes, "Tommy" had been killed the day before.
My groom, Morgan, was riding him. The Boche were sending over
shrapnel, high in the air, and one bullet had found its billet. Poor
little horse! Spirited, but easy to handle, always in condition,
always well-mannered. Ah, well! we had had many good days together.
Poor little horse!</p>

<hr />

<p>I want always to remember Bousies, the village of gardens and
hedgerows and autumn tints where we saw the war out, and lay under
shell fire for the last time; whence we fought our final battle on
November 4th, when young Hearn of A Battery was killed by machine-gun
bullets at 70 yards' range, and Major Bullivant, with a smashed arm
and a crippled thigh, huddled under a wall until Dumble found him&mdash;the
concluding fight that brought me a strange war trophy in a
golfing-iron found in a hamlet that the Boche had sprawled upon for
four full years.... And the name punched on the iron was that of an
Oxford Street firm.</p>

<p>Collinge and I rode into Bousies in the wan light of an October
afternoon. At a cross-roads that the Boche had blown up&mdash;"They didn't
do it well enough; the guns got round by that side track, and we were
only held up ten minutes," said Collinge&mdash;Brigade Headquarters'
sign-board had been planted in a hedge. My <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>way lay up a slushy
tree-bordered lane; Collinge bade me good-bye, and rode on down the
winding street.</p>

<p>There were the usual welcoming smiles. Manning gave me a "Had a good
leave, sir?" in his deep-sea voice, and Wilde came out to show where
my horse could be stabled. "It's a top-hole farm, and after the next
move we'll bring Headquarters waggon line up here.... The colonel says
you can have his second charger now that you've lost 'Tommy.' He's
taking on Major Veasey's mare, the one with the cold back that bucks a
bit. She's a nice creature if she's given plenty of work."</p>

<p>"How is the colonel?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's in great form; says the war may end any minute. Major
Simpson and Major Drysdale are both away on leave, and the colonel's
been up a good deal seeing the batteries register.... We got a shock
when we came into this place yesterday. A 4&middot;2 hit the men's
cook-house, that small building near the gate.... But they haven't
been troublesome since."</p>

<p>The end wall of the long-fronted narrow farmhouse loomed up gauntly
beside the pillared entrance to the rectangular courtyard. A
weather-vane in the form of a tin trotting horse flaunted itself on
the topmost point. This end wall rose to such height because, though
the farmhouse was one-storied, its steep-sloping roof enclosed an
attic big enough to give sixty men sleeping room. Just below the
weather-vane was a hole poked out by the Boche for observation
purposes. Our adjutant used to climb up to it twice daily as a sort of
constitutional. Some one had left in this perch a bound volume of a
Romanist weekly, with highly dramatic, fearfully coloured
illustrations. As the house contained some twenty of these volumes, I
presumed that they betrayed the religious leanings of the farm's
absent owner. A <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>row of decently ventilated stables faced the
farmhouse, while at the end of the courtyard, opposite to the entrance
gates, stood an enormous high-doored barn. The entrance-hall of the
house gave, on the left, to two connecting stone-flagged rooms, one of
which Manning used as a kitchen&mdash;Meddings, our regular cook, was on
leave. The other room, with its couple of spacious civilian beds, we
used as a mess, and the colonel and the adjutant slept there. The only
wall decorations were two "samplers" executed by a small daughter of
the house, a school certificate in a plain frame, and a couple of
gaudy-tinselled religious pictures. A pair of pot dogs on the
mantelpiece were as stupidly ugly as some of our own mid-Victorian
cottage treasures. And there were the usual glass-covered orange
blossoms mounted on red plush and gilt leaves&mdash;the wedding custom
traditional to the country districts of Northern France. The inner
door of this room opened directly into the stable where our horses
were stalled. An infantry colonel and his staff occupied the one large
and the two small rooms to the right of the entrance-hall; but after
dinner they left us to go forward, and my servant put down a mattress
on the stone floor of one of the smaller rooms for me to sleep upon.
Wilde took possession of the other little chamber. The large room,
which contained a colossal oak wardrobe, became our mess after
breakfast next day. The signallers had fixed their telephone exchange
in the vaulted cellar beneath the house, and the servants and grooms
crowded there as well when the Boche's night-shelling grew
threatening.</p>

<p>After a long deprivation we had come into a country where cabbages and
carrots, turnips and beetroot, were to be had for the picking; and
there were so many plates and glasses to be borrowed from the
farmhouse <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>cupboards that I feared greatly that Manning would feel
bound to rise to the unexampled occasion by exercising his well-known
gift for smashing crockery. We dined pleasantly and well that night;
and when the night-firing programme had been sent out to the
batteries&mdash;the Boche was in force in the big thick forest that lay
three thousand yards east of our farm&mdash;we settled down to a good
hour's talk. Wilde told me of the German sniper they had found shot
just before the advance to this village; the adjutant narrated the
magnificent gallantry of an officer who had relinquished his job of
Reconnaissance officer to the C.R.A. in order to join a battery, and
had now gone home with his third wound since Zillebeke. "You remember
how he came back in time for the August advance and got hit
immediately and wouldn't let them send him back to England&mdash;you know
we loaned him to the &nbsp;&mdash;rd Brigade because they were short of officers.
Well, he rolled up again about ten days ago, and got hit again in the
Le Cateau attack. Major 'Pat' told me he was wonderful.... Lay in a
shell-hole with his leg smashed&mdash;they poured blood out of his
boots&mdash;and commanded his battery from there, blowing his whistle and
all that, until they made him let himself be taken away." The colonel,
who listened and at the same time wrote letters, said that the thing
that pleased him most during the last few days was the patriotic
instinct of some cows. When the Hun evacuated Le Cateau he took away
with him all the able-bodied Frenchmen and all the cows. But his
retreat became so rapid and so confused, that numbers of the men
escaped. So did the cows: for three days they were dribbling back to
their homesteads and pasturages.</p>

<p>All through the night the enemy shelled Bousies. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>He planted only two
near us, but a splinter made a hole in the roof of the big barn and
caught a mule on the shoulder.</p>

<p>The doctor came up from the waggon line next morning and accompanied
me on a tour of the batteries. "If you follow the yellow wire you'll
come to B Battery," said Wilde. "They are in the corner of a meadow. A
Battery are not far away, across the stream." It was a golden autumn
day, and our feet rustled through the fallen yellow leaves that
carpeted a narrow lane bowered by high, luxuriant, winding hedges.
"Why, this place must be a paradise in peace times," said the doctor,
entranced by the sweet tranquillity of the spot. "It's like a lover's
walk you see in pictures." We strode over fallen trees and followed
the telephone wire across a strip of rich green. B Battery's guns were
tucked beneath some stubby full-leaved trees that would hide them from
the keenest-eyed aerial observer. "No sick, doctor," called Bob
Pottinger from underneath the trench-cover roof of his three-foot hole
in the ground. "We're improving the position and have no time to be
ill." The doctor and I crossed a sticky water-logged field, and passed
over the plank-bridge that spanned the slow vagrant stream. A battery
had their mess in one of the low creeper-clad cottages lining the
road. Their guns were thrust into the hedge that skirted the neat
garden at the back.</p>

<p>Major Bullivant gave me welcome, and read extracts from Sir Douglas
Haig's report on the Fifth Army Retreat&mdash;his 'Times' had just reached
him. He asked the doctor whether it was too early for a
whisky-and-soda, and showed us a Boche barometer, his latest war
trophy. "We've lost quite a lot of men since you've been away," he
told me. "Do you realise the Brigade <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>has been only four days out of
the line since August 1st? You've heard about young Beale being
wounded, of course? I was on leave, and so was Beadle; and Tincler was
sick, so there was only Dumble and Beale running the battery. Beale
got hit when shifting the waggon line, ... and it was rather fine of
him. He knew old Dumble was up to his eyes that day, and told the
sergeant-major not to tell Dumble what had happened to him, until the
battle was over. Did you hear, too, about Manison, one of the new
officers? Poor chap! Killed by a bomb dropped in daylight by one of
our own aeroplanes as he was going to the O.P.</p>

<p>"The Boche hasn't done much night-bombing lately. I don't think he's
got the 'planes. He gave us one terrible night, though, soon after we
crossed the canal, ... knocked out two of my guns and killed any
number of horses. There were ammunition dumps going up all over the
place that night; ... he stopped us from doing our night firing.</p>

<p>"Have you heard the story of the old woman at S&mdash;&mdash;?" he went on.
"When the bombardment was going on the civilians went down into the
cellars. The Germans hooked it, and the people came up from the
cellars. But Boche snipers were still in the village, and our advance
parties warned the inhabitants to keep below.... When, however, our
troops came along in a body, one old woman rushed forward from under
the church wall, in the square, you know.... She was excited, I
expect.... A swine of a Boche in a house on the far side of the square
shot her.... Our infantry surrounded that house."</p>

<p>"Well, I must quit," ejaculated the doctor suddenly. We went out and
made for the village road again. A screaming swish, and a report that
hurt the ears and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>shattered the windows in the front of the cottage.
A Boche high-velocity shell had crashed a few yards away on the other
side of the stream, and thrown up spouts of black slimy mud. The
doctor and I scurried back to the shelter of the cottage wall. Another
shell and another. A lieutenant-colonel of Infantry, on horseback,
swung violently round the corner and joined us. Three more shells
fell. Then silence. "These sudden bursts of fire are very
disconcerting, aren't they?" remarked the colonel as he mounted and
rode away.</p>

<p>"Say, now!" said the doctor to me. "I think we'll call back and have
that whisky-and-soda Major Bullivant offered us before we resume our
journey."</p>

<p>"We'll take a trip up to the 'O.P.' this morning," said the colonel to
me at breakfast on October 28th. The wind was sufficiently drying to
make walking pleasant, and to tingle the cheeks. The sun was a tonic;
the turned-up earth smelt good. Our Headquarter horses had been put
out to graze in the orchard&mdash;a Boche 4&middot;2 had landed in it the night
before&mdash;and they were frolicking mightily, Wilde's charger "Blackie"
being especially industrious shooing off one of the mules from the
colonel's mare. There was a swirling and a skelter of brown and yellow
leaves at the gap in the lane where we struck across a vegetable
garden. A square patch torn from a bed-sheet flew taut from the top of
a clump of long hop-poles&mdash;the sign, before the village was freed, to
warn our artillery observers that civilians lived in the cottage close
by. Similar, now out-of-date, white flags swung to the breeze from
many roof-tops in the village. "The extraordinary feature," the
colonel mentioned, "was the number of Tricolours that the French had
been able to hide from the Germans; they put them out when we <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>came
through." He nodded a pleasant good-day to a good looking young staff
officer who stood on the steps of the house in the <i>pav&eacute;</i>-laid street
where one of our infantry brigades had made their headquarters. The
staff officer wore a pair of those full-below-the-knee "plus 4 at
golf" breeches that the Gardee affects. "For myself, I wouldn't wear
that kind of breeches unless I were actually on duty with the Guards,"
said the colonel rather sardonically&mdash;"they are so intensely ugly." A
tiny piano tinkled at a corner house near the roofless church and the
Grande Place. In two-foot letters on the walls in the square were
painted, "Hommes" on some houses, "Femmes" on others: reminders of the
Boche method of segregating the sexes before he evacuated the
inhabitants he wanted to evacuate. Only five civilians remained in the
village now&mdash;three old men and two feeble decrepit women, numbed and
heart-sick with the war, but obstinate in clinging to their
homesteads. Already some of our men were patching leaky,
shrapnel-flicked roofs with biscuit-tins and strong strips of
waterproof sheeting.</p>

<p>We passed through A Battery's garden at nine o'clock. "We won't
disturb them," said the colonel. "Bullivant is a morning sleeper, and
is certain not to be up after the night-firing." Round the corner,
however, stood a new officer who looked smart and fresh, with brightly
polished buttons and Sam Browne belt. He saluted in the nervously
precise fashion of the newly-joined officer. The colonel answered the
salute, but did not speak; and he and I worked our way&mdash;following the
track of a Tank&mdash;through and between hedges and among fruit-trees that
had not yet finished their season's output. We passed the huddled-up
body of a shot <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>British soldier lying behind a fallen tree-trunk. We
were making for the quarry in which C and D Batteries were neighbours.
On a ditch-bordered road we met ten refugees, sent back that morning
from a hamlet a mile and a half away, not yet considered safe from the
Boche. The men, seeing us, removed their hats and lowered them as far
as the knee&mdash;the way in which the Boche had commanded them to proffer
respect. One aged woman in a short blue skirt wore sabots, and British
puttees in place of stockings.</p>

<p>There had been a mishap at D Battery in the early hours of the
morning. Their five useable 4&middot;5 howitzers had been placed in a perfect
how. position against the bank of the quarry. In the excitement of
night-firing a reinforcement gunner had failed to "engage the
plungers," the muzzle had not been elevated, and the shell, instead of
descending five thousand yards away, had hit the bank twelve yards in
front. The explosion killed two of the four men working that
particular how. and wounded a third, and knocked out the N.C.O. in
charge of another how. forty yards distant. The colonel examined the
howitzer, looked gravely severe, and said that an officers' inquiry
would be held next day. He asked Major Bartlett of C Battery, who was
housed in a toy-sized cottage in the centre of the quarry, how his
18-pdrs. were shooting; and mentioned that the infantry were
apprehensive of short-shooting along a road close to our present front
line, since it lay at an awkward angle for our guns. Major Bartlett,
self-possessed, competent, answered in the way the colonel liked
officers to answer&mdash;no "I thinks": his replies either plain "Yes" or
"No." Major Bartlett gave chapter and verse of his battery-shooting
during the two previous days, and said that every round had been
observed fire.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>Walking briskly&mdash;the colonel was the fittest man of forty-five I have
known&mdash;we mounted a slope of turnip-fields and fresh-ploughed land.
There was a plantation five hundred yards to right of us, and five
hundred yards to left of us; into the bigger one on the left two 5&middot;9's
dropped as we came level with it. Splashes of newly thrown-up earth
behind tree-clumps, against banks and alongside hedges, showed the
short breast-high trenches, some six yards long, in which the infantry
had fought a few days before. Fifteen hundred yards away the
clustering trees of the great forest where the enemy lay broke darkly
against the horizon. "You see that row of tall straight trees in front
of the forest, to the right of the gabled house where the white flag
is flying," said the colonel, pulling out his glasses&mdash;"that's the
present front line." Three ponderous booms from that direction denoted
trench mortars at work.</p>

<p>We descended the other side of the slope, keeping alongside a hedge
that ran towards a red-roofed farm. In two separate places about three
yards of the hedge had been cut away. "Boche soldiering!" remarked the
colonel informatively. "Enabled him to look along both sides of the
hedge and guard against surprise when our infantry were coming up.</p>

<p>"We may as well call at Battalion Headquarters," he added when we
reached the farm. In a wide cellar, where breakfast had not yet been
cleared away, we came upon a lieutenant-colonel, twenty-four years of
age, receiving reports from his company commanders. Suave in manner,
clear-eyed, not hasty in making judgments, he had learnt most things
to be known about real war at Thiepval, Schwaben Redoubt, and other
bloody places where the Division had made history; wounded again in
the August advance, he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>had refused to be kept from these final
phases. The colonel and he understood each other. There was the point
whether liaison duties between infantry and artillery could be more
usefully conducted in the swift-changing individual fighting of recent
days from infantry brigade or from infantry battalion; there were
conflicting statements by junior officers upon short-shooting, and
they required sifting; a few words had to be said about the
battalion's own stretch of front and its own methods of harassing the
enemy. A few crisp questions and replies, all bearing upon realities,
a smile or two, a consultation of maps, and another portion of the
colonel's task for that day was completed.</p>

<p>We walked across more ploughed land towards a sunken road, where
infantry could be seen congregated in that sort of <i>dolce far niente</i>
which, on the part of infantry in support, is really rather deceptive.</p>

<p>A "ping-ping!" whisked past, and stung us to alertness.</p>

<p>"Hullo&mdash;machine-guns!" ejaculated the colonel, and we quickened our
steps toward the sunken road.</p>

<p>A major and a subaltern of the machine-gunners clambered down the
opposite bank.</p>

<p>"I believe I've spotted that fellow, sir," burst forth the major with
some excitement. "I think he's in a house over there ... might be a
target for you ... bullets have been coming from that way every now
and again for two days.... I'll show you, if you like, sir."</p>

<p>The major and the colonel crept out on top of the bank, and made for a
shell-hole forty yards in front. I followed them. The major pointed
across the rolling grass lands to a two-storied grey house with a
slate <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>roof, fourteen hundred yards away. "I believe he's in there,"
he said with decision.</p>

<p>The colonel looked through his glasses.</p>

<p>The major spoke again. "Do you see the square piece removed from the
church spire, sir?... That looks like an 'O.P.', doesn't it?"</p>

<p>The colonel opened his map and pointed to a tiny square patch. "I make
that to be the house," he said. "Do you agree?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," replied the major. "We thought at first it was the house
you see marked four hundred yards more south-east; but I believe that
is really the one."</p>

<p>"I've got an 'O.P.' farther forward. I'm going up there now. We'll
have a shot at the house," responded the colonel simply.</p>

<p>The major went back to the sunken road. The colonel and I walked
straight ahead, each of us in all probability wondering whether the
Boche machine-gunner was still on duty, and whether he would regard us
as worthy targets. That, at any rate, was my own thought. We strode
out over the heavy-going across a strip of ploughed land, and heard
the whizz of machine-gun bullets once more, not far from the spot we
had just left. We did not speak until we descended to a dip in the
ground, and reached a brook that had to be jumped. We were absolutely
by ourselves.</p>

<p>Up the slope, on the far side of the brook. More ploughed land. We
were both breathing hard now.</p>

<p>Before we came to the crest of the slope the colonel stopped. "We're
in view from the Boche front line from the top," he said sharply. "The
'O.P.' is a hole in the ground.... You had better follow me about
twenty yards behind.... And keep low.... Make <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>for the fifth
telegraph-pole from the left that you will see from the top."</p>

<p>He moved off. I waited and then followed, my mind concentrated at
first on the fifth telegraph-pole the colonel had spoken about. There
was no shelling at this moment. A bird twittered in a hedge close by;
the smell of grass and of clean earth rose strong and sweet. No signs
or sound of war; only sunshine and trees and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The colonel's voice came sharp as whipcord. "Keep down!&mdash;keep down!" I
bent almost double and walked fast at the same time. My mind turned to
September 1916, when I walked along Pozi&egrave;res Ridge, just before the
Courcellette fight, and was shouted at for not crouching down by my
battery commander. But there were shells abroad that day.... I almost
laughed to myself.</p>

<p>I tumbled after the colonel into the square hole that constituted the
"O.P."&mdash;it had been a Boche trench-mortar emplacement. The sweat
dripped down my face as I removed my tin hat; my hair was wet and
tangled.</p>

<p>Johns, a subaltern of D Battery, was in the pit with a couple of
telephonists. He was giving firing instructions to the battery.</p>

<p>"What are you firing at, Johns?" inquired the colonel, standing on a
step cut in the side of the pit, and leaning his elbows on the
parapet.</p>

<p>"Two hundred yards behind that road, sir&mdash;trench mortars suspected
there, sir." He called, "All guns parallel!" down the telephone.</p>

<p>"Don't you keep your guns parallel when you aren't firing?" asked the
colonel quickly. "Isn't that a battery order?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>Johns flushed and replied, "No, sir.... We left them as they were
after night-firing."</p>

<p>"But don't you know that it is an Army order&mdash;that guns should be left
parallel?"</p>

<p>"Y-e-es, sir."</p>

<p>"Why don't you obey it, then?"</p>

<p>"I thought battery commanders were allowed their choice. I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The colonel cut poor Johns short. "It's an Army order, and has to be
obeyed. Army orders are not made for nothing. The reason that order
was made was because so many battery commanders were making their own
choice in the matter. Consequently there was trouble and delay in
'handing over.' So the Army made a standard ruling."</p>

<p>Then, as was always the case, the colonel softened in manner, and told
Johns to do his shooting just as if he were not looking on.</p>

<p>The new subaltern of A Battery suddenly lowered himself into the pit.
The colonel brightened. "You see the grey house over there!... Can you
see it?... Good!... An enemy machine-gun is believed to be there.... I
want you to fire on that house.... There's the point on the map."</p>

<p>"Sorry, sir, my wire to the battery is not through yet&mdash;I've just been
out on it."</p>

<p>The colonel looked at his watch. "It's half-past eleven now. Your line
ought to be through by this time."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; it's been through once, but it went half an hour ago. I
expect my signallers back any minute."</p>

<p>"Very well! you can be working out your switch angle and your angle of
sight while you wait."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>Johns had now got his battery to work, and the sight of his shells
bursting among the hedges and shrubs fired his Celtic enthusiasm and
dissipated the nervousness he had felt in the colonel's presence.
"Look at that! isn't that a fine burst?" he called, clutching my
arm,&mdash;"and see that one. Isn't it a topper?"</p>

<p>An exclamation from the colonel, who had stood sphinx-like, his
glasses directed upon the grey house, made every one turn. "I've
spotted him," he called, his voice vibrating. "He's at the top-floor
window nearest to us.... There he goes again.... I heard the 'ping'
and saw dust come out of the window.... Now then, is that line through
yet?"</p>

<p>The line wasn't through, and the excitement of the hunt being upon us,
every one felt like cursing all telephone lines&mdash;they always did break
down when they were most wanted. The five minutes before this line was
reported to be through seemed an hour, and when the telephonist had
laboriously to repeat the orders, each one of us itched to seize the
telephone and shout ribald abuse at the man at the other end.</p>

<p>The first shell went into the trees behind the house. So did the
round, three hundred yards shorter in range, by which it had been
hoped to complete a plus and minus bracketing of the target. After a
bold shortening of the range, the subaltern, directing the shooting of
A Battery's guns, was about to order a wide deflection to the left,
but the colonel stopped him. "Your line is all right," he said. "It
looks as if you were too much to the right from the 'O.P.', but that's
the deceptiveness of flank observation. The range is short, that's
all. Give it another hundred yards and see what happens."</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>A direct hit resulted in twenty rounds, and there was jubilation in
the "O.P." M'Whirter of C Battery turned up, also Captain Hopton of B,
and preparations for a window-to-window searching and harrying of the
Boche machine-gunners were eagerly planned. It was 2 <span class="fakesc">P.M.</span>
now, and the colonel had forgotten all about lunch. "I think we can
get back now," he said brightly. "Register on that house," he added,
turning to the officers in the pit, "and you can give that
machine-gunner a hot time whenever he dares to become troublesome."</p>

<p>We walked back to the sunken road in the highest of spirits, and after
the major of the Machine-Gun Corps, who had watched the shooting, had
thanked the colonel and expressed the view that the Boche
machine-gunner might in future be reckoned among the down-and-outs,
the colonel talked of other things besides gunnery.</p>

<p>I told him that though on my last leave to England I had noted a new
seriousness running through the minds of people, I had not altogether
found the humble unselfishness, the chastened spirit that many
thinkers had prophesied as inevitable and necessary before the coming
of victory.</p>

<p>"But what about the men who have been out here? Won't they be the
people of England after the war&mdash;the real representative people?"
returned the colonel, his eyes lighting up as he talked. "Theirs has
been the chastening experience, at any rate. The man who comes through
this must be the better man for it."</p>

<p>The conversation lost its seriousness when we discussed whether Army
habits would weave themselves into the ordinary workaday world as a
result of the war.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>"Some of them would be good for us," said the colonel happily. "Here's
one"&mdash;picking up a rifle and carrying it at the slope&mdash;"I'm going to
carry this to the first salvage dump, and help to keep down taxation."</p>

<p>"It might be an interesting experiment to run Society on Active
Service lines," I put in. "Fancy being made an Acting-Baronet and then
a Temporary-Baronet before getting substantive rank. And the thought
of an Acting-Duke paralyses one."</p>

<p>We laughed and walked on. Along the road leading back into the village
we met a bombardier, who saluted the colonel with the direct glance
and the half-smile that betokens previous acquaintance. The colonel
stopped. "What's your name, Bombardier?" he demanded. The bombardier
told him. "Weren't you in my battery?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," said the man, smiling, "when we first came to France....
I'd like to be back in the old Division, sir."</p>

<p>"I'll see what can be done," said the colonel, taking his name and
number.</p>

<p>"I believe I remember him, because he often came before me as a
prisoner," he told me, with a humorous look, as we continued our walk.
"Very stout fellow, though."</p>

<p>It was a quarter-past three now, and the experiences of the day had
sharpened the appetite. The colonel wasn't finished yet, however. He
turned into the Infantry Brigade Headquarters, and spent a quarter of
an hour with the brigadier general and his brigade-major discussing
the artillery work that would be required for the next big advance. We
discovered a lane we hadn't <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>walked through before, and went that way
to our farmhouse. It was four o'clock when we got back, and two
batteries had prisoners waiting to go before the colonel. So lunch was
entirely wiped off the day's programme, and at a quarter to five we
sat down to tea and large quantities of buttered toast.</p>

<h3>XIX. "THE COLONEL&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="totoc"><a href="#toc">ToC</a></span></h3>
<br />

<p>We knew now that November 4th was the date fixed for the next battle.
The C.R.A. had offered the Brigade two days at the waggon lines, as a
rest before zero day. The colonel didn't want to leave our farm, but
two nights at the waggon lines would mean respite from night-firing
for the gunners; so he had asked the battery commanders to choose
between moving out for the two days and remaining in the line. They
had decided to stay.</p>

<p>It turned to rain on October 29th. Banks of watery, leaden-hued clouds
rolled lumberingly from the south-west; beneath a slow depressing
drizzle the orchard became a melancholy vista of dripping branches and
sodden muddied grass. The colonel busied himself with a captured
German director and angle-of-sight instrument, juggling with the
working parts to fit them for use with our guns&mdash;he had the knack of
handling intricate mechanical appliances. The adjutant curled himself
up among leave-rosters and ammunition and horse returns; I began
writing the Brigade Diary for October, and kept looking over the
sandbag that replaced the broken panes in my window for first signs of
finer weather.</p>

<p>The colonel and the adjutant played Wilde and myself at bridge that
night&mdash;the first game in our mess <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>since April. Then the colonel and I
stayed up until midnight, talking and writing letters: he showed me a
diminutive writing-pad that his small son had sent by that day's post.
"That's a reminder that I owe him a letter," he smiled. "I must write
him one.... He's just old enough now to understand that I was coming
back to the war, the last time I said good-bye." The colonel said this
with tender seriousness.</p>

<p>A moaning wind sprang up during the night, and, sleepless, I tossed
and turned upon my straw mattress until past two o'clock. One 4&middot;2 fell
near enough to rattle the remaining window-panes. The wail through the
air and the soft "plop" of the gas shells seemed attuned to the
dirge-like soughing of the wind.</p>

<p>The morning broke calm and bright. There was the stuffiness of
yesterday's day indoors to be shaken off. I meant to go out early. It
was our unwritten rule to leave the colonel to himself at breakfast,
and I drove pencil and ruler rapidly, collating the intelligence
reports from the batteries. I looked into the mess again for my cap
and cane before setting forth. The colonel was drinking tea and
reading a magazine propped up against the sugar-basin. "I'm going
round the batteries, sir," I said. "Is there anything you want me to
tell them&mdash;or are you coming round yourself later?"</p>

<p>"No; not this morning. I shall call on the infantry about eleven&mdash;to
talk about this next battle."</p>

<p>"Right, sir!"</p>

<p>He nodded, and I went out into the fresh cool air of a bracing autumn
day.</p>

<p>I did my tour of the batteries, heard Beadle's jest about the new
groom who breathed a surprised "Me an' all?" when told that he was
expected to accompany his officer on a ride up to the battery; and,
leaving A <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>Battery's cottage at noon, crossed the brook by the little
brick bridge that turned the road towards our Headquarters farm, six
hundred yards away.</p>

<p>"The colonel rang up a few minutes ago to say that our notice-board at
the bottom of the lane had been blown down. He wanted it put right,
because the General is coming to see him this afternoon, and might
miss the turning.... I've told Sergeant Starling.</p>

<p>"Colonel B&mdash;&mdash; came in about eleven o'clock," went on the adjutant.
"He's going on leave and wanted to say good-bye to the colonel."</p>

<p>"Where is the colonel now," I asked, picking up some Divisional
reports that had just arrived.</p>

<p>"He's with the Heavies&mdash;he's been to the Infantry. I told him Colonel
B&mdash;&mdash; had called, and he said he'd go round and see him&mdash;their mess is
in the village, isn't it?"</p>

<p>At twelve minutes past one the adjutant, Wilde, and myself sat down to
lunch. "The colonel said he wouldn't be late&mdash;but we needn't wait,"
said the adjutant.</p>

<p>"No; we don't want to wait," agreed Wilde, who had been munching
chocolate.</p>

<p>At a quarter-past one; "Crump!" "Crump!" "Crump!"&mdash;the swift, crashing
arrival of three high-velocity shells.</p>

<p>"I'll bet that's not far from A Battery," called Wilde, jumping up;
and then settled down again to his cold beef and pickles.</p>

<p>"First he's sent over to-day," said the adjutant. "He's been awfully
quiet these last two days."</p>

<p>Manning had brought in the bread-and-butter and apple pudding that
Meddings had made to celebrate his return from leave, when the door
opened abruptly. Gillespie, the D.A. gas officer stood there. It was
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>habit to complain with mock-seriousness that Gillespie timed his
visits with our meal-times. I had begun calling "Here he is again,"
when something drawn, something staring in his lean Scotch face,
stopped me. I thought he was ill.</p>

<p>The adjutant and Wilde were gazing curiously at him. My eyes left his
face. I noticed that his arms were pushed out level with his chest; he
grasped an envelope between the thumb and forefinger of each hand. His
lower jaw had fallen; his lips moved, and no sound came from them.</p>

<p>The three of us at the table rose to our feet. All our faculties were
lashed to attention.</p>

<p>Gillespie made a sort of gulp. "I've got terrible news," he said at
last.</p>

<p>I believe that one thought, and only one thought, circuited through
the minds of the adjutant, Wilde, and myself: The colonel!&mdash;we knew!
we knew!</p>

<p>"The colonel&mdash;&mdash;" went on Gillespie. His face twitched.</p>

<p>Wilde was first to speak. "Wounded?" he forced himself to ask, his
eyes staring.</p>

<p>"Killed!&mdash;killed!" said Gillespie, his voice rising to a hoarse wail.</p>

<p>Then silence. Gillespie reached for a chair and sank into it.</p>

<p>I heard him, more master of himself, say labouringly, "Down at the
bridge near A Battery.... He and another colonel ... both killed ...
they were standing talking.... I was in A Battery mess.... A direct
hit, I should think."</p>

<p>The adjutant spoke in crushed awestruck tones. "It must have been
Colonel B&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p>I did not speak. I could not. I thought of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>colonel as I had known
him, better than any of the others: his gentleness, his
honourableness, his desire to see good in everything, his quiet
collected bravery, the clear alertness of his mind, the thoroughness
with which he followed his calling of soldier; a man without a mean
thought in his head; a true soldier who had received not half the
honours his gifts deserved, yet grumbled not. Ah! no one passed over
in the sharing out of honours and promotions could complain if he
paused to think of the colonel.</p>

<p>I stared through the window at the bright sunlight. Dimly I became
aware that Gillespie had laid the envelope upon the table, and heard
him say he had found it lying in the roadway. I noticed the
handwriting: the last letter the colonel had received from his wife.
It must have been blown clean out of his jacket pocket; yet there it
was, uninjured.</p>

<p>The adjutant's voice, low, solemn, but resolved&mdash;he had his work to
do: "It is absolutely certain it was the colonel? There is no shadow
of doubt? I shall have to report to 'Don Ack'!"</p>

<p>"No shadow of doubt," replied Gillespie hopelessly, moving his head
from side to side.</p>

<p>Wilde came to me and asked if I would go with him to bring in the
body. I shook my head. Life out here breeds a higher understanding of
the mystic division between soul and body; one learns to contemplate
the disfigured dead with a calmness that is not callousness. But this
was different. How real a part he had played in my life these last two
years! I wanted always to be able to recall him as I had known him
alive&mdash;the slow wise smile, the crisp pleasant voice! I thought of
that last note to his little son; I thought of the quiet affection in
his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>voice when he spoke of keeping in touch with those who had shared
the difficulties and the hardships of the life we had undergone. I
recalled how he and I had carried a stretcher and searched for a dying
officer at Zillebeke&mdash;the day I was wounded,&mdash;and how, when I was in
hospital, he had written saying he was glad we had done our bit that
day; I thought of his happy faith in a Christmas ending of the war.
The hideous cruelty of it to be cut off at the very last, when all
that he had given his best in skill and energy to achieve was in
sight!</p>

<hr />

<p>The shuffling tramp outside of men carrying a blanket-covered
stretcher. They laid it tenderly on the flagstones beneath the
sun-warmed wall of the house.</p>

<p>Wilde, his face grave, sad, desolate, walked through the mess to his
room. I heard him rinsing his hands. A chill struck at my vitals.</p>

<hr />

<p>It is finished. The colonel is dead. There is nothing more to write.</p>
